This is the Frequent-Asked-Questions (FAQ) file for Expect

This file represents questions I've received (with answers I've given)
about subjects that don't fit in the man page for one reason or
another.  I suppose I could've stripped off the headers, but it seems
more realistic to see actual people who've asked the questions.
Thanks to everyone who asked.

Hopefully, no one is embarrassed by seeing their name here.  If
anything, this probably reflects most poorly on me because it shows a
number of ideas other people would like me to add to Expect, that I
haven't.

Long rows of hyphens separate the different topics.  In cases where
I've reprinted the original question-letter and my answer, the two are
separated by a short row of hyphens.

The papers listed in the README file should also be consulted for highly
technical or philosophical discussion of the implementation, design and
practical application of Expect.

Root-access is needed to open a pty under Unicos.  Thus, all programs
accessing ptys must be setuid root.  If you do an "ls -l" of programs
like "script", "xterm", etc, you'll see this.

I have no idea why this is.  The requirement was probably for security
reasons to begin with, but it has the ironic effect of making more
programs require setuid and therefore greater possibility of errant
setuid programs.

In fact, there is one known Unicos bug relating to the way uids are
switched at exec time which requires further special coding.  If you
search for "Cray" in the Expect source you will see significant chunks
of code to get around the problem.

I don't know if this reassures you any.  All I can tell you is that a
number of Cray experts have looked into the situation and are happy
with the current implementation of Expect.

Perhaps I'm too myopic, but I don't see the need for it.  I typically
get two or three expect questions a week, which I answer myself.

For one reason or another (usually a bug fix, but often, just revising
the documentation), I update expect about once every two weeks.
Personally, I'd hate being on the other end of something like this.
Who needs patches every two weeks for problems that probably aren't
even relevant to you?

>It would be helpful, too, if this served as an area for swapping programs.
>Many of the things that I want to do are done by others already.

Send me things that you'd like to distribute.  I'll either include
them with expect or put it in a publicly accessible directory so other
people can get it.  Yes, I know it's not as good as getting notified
via a mailing list, but actually I doubt there's such a need.  The
reality is that most of the programs expect is applied to have
poorly defined interfaces.  There are few portable expect scripts.

For example, you can't even write a guaranteed-portable script that
knows what a shell prompt looks like because everyone customizes them!
And the ftp scripts don't work on everyone's ftp because the ftp user
interface is not specified by the standard, so everyone's is
different.  And so on.

There is a Tcl newsgroup, comp.lang.tcl, which many expect users read.
It's pretty good for asking questions about Tcl, and there isn't that
much traffic that an occasional Expect question isn't looked upon
favorably.  Indeed, some of the sharpest Tcl hackers read the mailing
list, so I post news about new-releases of expect there first.  The
newsgroup is gatewayed to a mailing list (tcl@sprite.berkeley.edu)
which is further described in the Tcl documentation.

Those of us in the family pronounce it "OH-stir-howt", where the
first syllable rhymes with "low", the second with "purr", and the
third with "doubt".  Unfortunately this isn't the correct Dutch
pronounciation for a name spelled this way (someplace along
the line it got misspelled:  it was originally "Oosterhout"), nor
is it what you'd guess if you use common sense.  So, we've gotten
used to responding to almost anything.

I suppose I should say something in kind.  "Libes" is pronounced
"Lee-bus" with stress on the first syllable.  Like John, though, I've
gotten used to responding to anything close. - Don

No.  These files are part of a test suite that I use.  However, I'm
not distributing them (yet) because they are too fragile.  (One of our
less experienced students wrote them, and he didn't do a very good
job, I'm afraid.  I have to go back and clean them up at some point.)
But it's not high on my priority list.

In the meantime, try some of the programs distributed in the test
directory.  They are a strong indication of whether expect works or
not.  If you any problems with them, let me know.

I'd like to see how they do it.  The major problem is when you type
characters, they are invariably echoed.  So if you "interact" with a
system and type "finger", what expect sees is that
you typed 'f',
computer typed 'f',
you typed 'i',
computer typed 'i',
you typed 'n',
computer typed 'n',
...

I.e. expect has no way of knowing that you weren't waiting to see the
computer say 'f', before you typed 'f'.

You'd have to handle problems like this, kind of guessing if the
computer is echoing or you are really waiting for the response.  The
system actually doesn't echo exactly what you type, making this even
harder.  And there are other problems: sometimes characters get lumped
together rather than sent separately, sometimes echoing is turned off
for you.

If you run expect in debug mode while doing "interact", you'll see
what I mean.

Given that you'd have to do such severe editing of an automatically
produced script, I figure writing the script from scratch is easier.

Actually, I suggest you used the interact facility (or the UNIX script
program) and just edit the output.  Invariably, you want to change a
lot of text to *s and add alternatives (i.e. a lot of editing) anyway.

Do you have to do much editing with scripts that Red Ryder produces?
How does it handle these problems?  Does it support regular
expressions and alternation?  (Obviously, a computer-generated script
can't generate these automatically.)  Do you have to tell it whether
you are full/half-duplex or what kind of line-termination characters
you are using?

Is there anything else in Red Ryder that would be useful in expect?

>Before I look into adding a "watch me" feature, I thought I should

You're welcome to give it a shot.  I'd be interested to see what you
come up with.

That appears to be what Red Ryder does.  It works surprisingly well
for line-oriented things.  It produces unnecessarily lengthy (though
still working) scripts when you make a lot of corrections by
backspacing.  And it isn't suitable for character-oriented things like
editors, where there is no notion of a prompt.

Ah, thanks for the tip.  I hadn't appreciated the problem.

I'm working with text editors and document viewers, so for every
character typed there can be a lot of output.  It wouldn't make sense
for me to wade through all that output and trim it down.

Writing the scripts from scratch, as you suggested, is currently my
best approach.  I'm also experimenting with a command which logs just
the input.

 > Do you have to do much editing with scripts that Red Ryder produces?

Here's an example from Microphone (another Macintosh communications
program), which is not as sophisticated in its watchme mode as Red
Ryder.  I had it watch me while I typed "echo this is a test" to the
shell.  It's pretty stupid, but (to my surprise) the script
nevertheless works, without any editing.

	6   Wait for Text  "% "
	7   Send Text String  "echo"
	8   Wait for Text  "% ech"
	9   Send Text String  " "
	10  Wait for Text  "echo "
	11  Send Text String  "this"
	12  Wait for Text  "o thi"
	13  Send Text String  " "
	14  Wait for Text  "this "
	15  Send Text String  "is a "
	16  Wait for Text  "is a "
	17  Send Text String  "te"
	18  Wait for Text  " a te"
	19  Send Text String  "st"
	20  Wait for Text  " test"
	21  Send Text String  "^M"
	22  Wait for Line Containing  " test"

Here's an example of the same thing done with Red Ryder watching.
Much better!

	PROMPT % 
	PAUSE
	TYPE echo this is a test^M
	PROMPT % 

Red Ryder appears to keep track of what was typed and eliminate that
from any possible prompts.  As you pointed out, what was typed is not
always what was printed, but in my experience (mostly using it to dial
up to UNIX sites) this hasn't been a problem.

 > How does it handle these problems?  Does it support regular

No, just literals.  Red Ryder won't go back further than the last line
of output, which usually works better than Microphone's more generous
approach. 

 > Do you have to tell it whether you are full/half-duplex or what
 > kind of line-termination characters you are using?

Since it's a communications program it already has the info, but I
don't know that it uses this information when it creates the scripts.

 > Is there anything else in Red Ryder that would be useful in expect?

Good question.  I think expect has these programs beat though, with
the exception of a watchme feature.  A visual interface would be nice,
as one thing that I miss from Red Ryder is the status line, which
tells you the current command.  (I know you can sort of simulate this
by tracing the TCL code.)  Some of my expect scripts are long and it's
helpful to know what they are sending/expecting when they pause/hang.
As long as I'm dreaming, it would also be nice if I could single-step
through a script by pressing a "single-step" button.  I guess these
are more TCL issues than expect issues.

Microphone has a nice interface for novices.  You can write a script
with very little typing by pointing and clicking from menus of
keywords.  Red Ryder's language is less verbose and probably more
powerful, but neither is as powerful/flexible as expect/TCL.

Since it's not quite so useful for character-oriented editors as for
line-oriented things, I've decided for now just to write the scripts
from scratch.

I'll say again that I like the tool a lot--nice work!  There are other
people here using it for things like the testing of ksh, which
responds differently to signals when not used interactively.

I have some mods to make expect run on a Cray.  I was sort of waiting
to see if the mods are Cray-specific or System V specific before
forwarding them, but if you would like to incorporate them right away
I will send them.

I've never said anything like that, nor is it true (although I will admit
that I've had a lot of trouble learning Perl.)  Fact is, I've written
several Perl hacks, at least one of which is used daily at my site.

Actually, I discussed these issues with several people during the
development of expect.  The approach I took effectively sealed off the
user from the underlying C implementation, substituting the more shell-
like Tcl language and reducing the ability to screw themselves somehow.

In the approach you took, the user language IS Perl, which provides
incredible power and flexibility.  The primary disadvantage is that
the user may have to learn Perl, which is hard.

Also, as you noticed, some of the features (like logging) are a problem
for Perl.  Oh, and as you suspected, recursive invocations are useful -
consider writing scripts that are half automated and half interactive,
like the fsck script I showed at the LISA conference.

Please don't get me wrong.  I think Perl is very useful.  I desperately
want a copy of your book.  And I consider it a compliment that you
followed my implementation as faithfully as you did.  Though, I did
think some of your Perl code pretty weird!

Actually, in my USENIX paper I stated that I fully expected someone to
incorporate the expect primitives into a shell, Perl, whatever.  I was
just showing proof of concept.  It just happened to turn out to be
worth keeping around.

In fact, I owe a lot for it to John Ousterhout who wrote Tcl.

Ironically, Tcl was written specifically to halt this very problem.

The author recognized that every utility seems to have its own
idiosyncratic .rc file or programming language.  Tcl was designed as a
general-purpose language that could be included with any utility, to
avoid having everyone hack up their own new language.

In this context, your statements to the newsgroup do Tcl a great
disservice.
