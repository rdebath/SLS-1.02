VERSION:
    R5, public-patch-17
    [MIT public patches will edit this line to indicate the patch level]

CLIENT MACHINE and OPERATING SYSTEM:
    [e.g. Sparc/SunOS 4.1.1, DECstation 3100/Ultrix 4.2, ...]

DISPLAY TYPE:
    [e.g. Sun GX, 8-bit framebuffer, IBM APA16 ...]

WINDOW MANAGER:
    [e.g. twm, gwm, olwm, mwm, ...]

COMPILER:

AREA:
    [Area of the source tree affected,
     e.g., server, Xlib, Xt, Xaw, PEX, twm, xterm, xmh, config, ....
     Please only one area per bug report.]

SYNOPSIS:
    [Brief description of the problem and where it is located]

DESCRIPTION:
    [Detailed description of problem.  Don't just say "<blah>
     doesn't work, here's a fix," explain what your program does
     to get to the <blah> state.  If this is a request for an
     enhancement, justify it.]

REPEAT BY:
    [What you did to get the error; include test program or session
     transcript if at all possible.  If you include a program, make
     sure it depends only on libraries in the MIT X distribution, not
     on any vendor or third-party libraries.  Be specific; if we can't
     reproduce it, we can't fix it.  Don't just say "run this program
     and it will be obvious," tell us exactly what we should see when
     the program is run.  Bug reports without a clear, deterministic
     way of reproducing them will be fixed only after all bug reports
     that do.]

SAMPLE FIX:
    [Preferred, but not necessary.  Please send context diffs (diff -c).
     Be sure to include our "XConsortium" ident line in any diffs.  The
     best way to do this is to add your own versioning line immediately
     after ours.]

[PLEASE make your Subject: line as descriptive as possible.
 Subjects like "xterm bug" or "bug report" are not helpful!]
[Remove all the explanatory text in brackets before mailing.]
