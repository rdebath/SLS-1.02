NOTE: The referenced files "TrueType", "TrueType Fonts", and "Font_DA_Mover"
have been removed from the distribution.  We regret any inconvenience.

The files in this directory implement a *prototype* font server for
Apple Macintosh computers running the A/UX operating system. The font
server, MacFS, runs only under the Macintosh Toolbox environment
available in A/UX 2.0 and later. It will not run under the ordinary
Macintosh system software, nor will it run under the "Native X11"
environment provided by the XmacII server.

Also provided here are the TrueType font set, the TrueType renderer "INIT", 
and a tool to install the fonts. Adding these TrueType components to 
the A/UX "System Folder" allows MacFS to serve the TrueType fonts on the net.
In addition, MacFS serves the bitmap and Speedo fonts just as the "fs" server
does as well as offering the Macintosh "screen-tuned" bitmap fonts.

MacFS is implemented as an instance of a "Font File" renderer. It looks
to the file /usr/lib/X11/fonts/MacFont/fonts.dir for the names of
fonts it will serve. Two example fonts.dir files as well as a config file
are provided here. 

MacFS is a *sample* implementation, it lacks many of the features one
would expect in a fully developed Font Server product. Among the most
important limitations are:

      - Only 8-bit encodings are supported.
      - The usual Apple 8-bit encoding for the Latin-1 character set
        ("Macintosh extended Ascii") differs from iso8859-1 at 7 places:
        0xbc, 0xbd, 0xbe, 0xd0, 0xde, 0xf0, 0xfe.
      - Fonts are only rendered at one bit per pixel.
      - Performance rendering the TrueType fonts on low-end
        CPUs is inadequate.

The remainder of this note describes how to build and install MacFS.

One of the tools used to build the UI for the MacFS font server,
/mac/bin/rez, *must* be executed from the A/UX Macintosh environment.
For this reason the Makefile does not automatically build MacFS.
Here's how it goes:

(1) build all the other font stuff

(2) Logon to A/UX from the MacII console and enter the A/UX Macintosh
environment.

(3) In fonts/server/MacFS do "make MacFS %MacFS".

(4) The successful result of the make is a "hybrid" application:
MacFS. You can start it up in the usual way from the shell, or
double-click on it from the A/UX Finder. A primitive user interface
should appear. 

(5) Copy the config file to /usr/lib/X11/fs/config.

(6) Copy the fonts.dir file to /usr/lib/X11/fonts/MacFont/fonts.dir.

The following steps add the TrueType outline fonts to the A/UX
System File, and add the TrueType renderer to the System Folder (as
an "INIT").

(1) Copy the file named "TrueType" to "/mac/sys/System Folder" and
to any "personal System Folder" you might have.

(2) Launch (from the shell or by double-clicking) "Font_DA_Mover".

(3) Choose "Open" from the Font_DA_Mover

(4) Choose "Open" from the File Dialog (which should display
"TrueType Fonts" highlighted).

(5) Shift select all the TrueType fonts.

(6) Click on "<< Copy".

(7) Quit from the Font_DA_Mover.

(8) Logout of the A/UX session and then log back in. Start MacFS,
it will now serve both Macintosh bitmap and TrueType fonts.
