Subject: Enhanced Ethercard driver available for alpha test.

My "8390" Linux ethercard drivers are now available from usra.edu and
super.org in ~ftp/pub/linux/ethercards/*.  They'll be at tsx-11 and
sunsite RSN.

These drivers support all common 8390-based ethernet boards.  Currently
"common" is defined as:

	3Com Products:
*	3Com 3c503	Board loaned by Chance Reschke, USRA.edu (thanks!)
	3Com 3c503/16	and excellent documentation provided by 3Com.

	Clones-n-things
	NE1000		Novell and Eagle are useless for documentation,
*	NE2000		but copied the designs directly from NatSemi;->.

	WD/SMC products
	WD8003
*	WD8013		Board loaned by Russ Nelson, Crynwr Software.  Thanks!

* I've seen it work myself!

There is support for the following boards, but since I've only been
able to borrow a thinnet of an HP ethercard I haven't been able to test it:

	HP LAN adaptors
**	HP27245
**	HP27247
**	HP27250

Thanks are due to the dozens of alpha testers, and special thanks to Chance Reschke <@usra.edu> and Russ Nelson <@crynwr.com> for loaning me ethercards.

A list of "NE2000" clones that are reported to work:
	Alta Combo(NE2000 clone)
	Aritsoft LANtastic AE-2 (NE2000 clone w/ extra memory)
	D-Link Ethernet II
	SVEC 4 Dimension Ethernet
	4-Dimension FD0490 EtherBoard16
    	Cabletron products:
	  I've had a really bad time with Cabletron -- they strung
	  me along for months before telling me all information was
	  proprietary.  The following boards work, but there probably
	  won't be drivers for other versions.  Complain to pkelly@ctron.com.
	 E1010		No ID PROM and sketchy info from Ctron means you'll
	 E1010-x 	have to compile-in information about your board.
	 E2010
	 E2010-x
