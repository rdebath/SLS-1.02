A circle of radius
.Fi radius
is drawn, centered at
the current

The points at the edge of the circle are
set, cleared or inverted
depending upon the last call to
.Fr m_func
\&.
Circles are always drawn as circles, both in

bytes of
.Fi data
are sent to \*M are to be interpreted as lines drawn in
.I "fast draw"
mode,
starting at
the current graphics point.
.I "Fast draw"
mode permits the rapid drawing of short vectors
by encoding an 
.I x,y
displacement in a single byte.
The 
.I x
coordinate is contained in the most significant
4 bits, the
.I y
coordinate in the least significant 4 bits.
Values for
.I x
and
.I y
represent displacements from the previous location, and
range from +7 to -8.
A 7 is coded as

a -8 as
.B 0x00 .
If both 
.I x
and
.I y
are zero (i.e.
.B 0x8080 ).
The next coordinate is taken to be a

mouse button.
Menus are downloaded (with
.Fr m_loadmenu
) first, then selected.
Only one menu may be selected at a time on each button.
If the button is already down when this call is made, and there is not currently
a menu associated with the button, then the menu just selected pops-up
immediately.
This last feature may be used to pop up different menus 
in a context sensitive way.

\&.
All output goes to the selected
window until either
.Fr m_selectwin
is called to change windows,
or the selected window is destroyed.
If
.Fi n
is 0 (zero) or the currently selected window is destroyed,
the main, or original window is selected.
Input from all windows is
send to the client program on the same input channel.
The macro
.Fr m_setevent ACTIVATE
 may be used to help decide what window generated the input
by associating a unique string with each window's 
.SM
.I ACTIVATE
.LG
event.
The
.I selected
window 
and the
.I active
window are specified independently.
Selecting a window does not make it the 
.I active 
window, and creating a new window, although it is created as the 
.I active
window, is not automatically selected.

.Fs m_sendto 12 "Send a message to another window"
The message
.Fi string
is send to window
.Fi n .
A unique window identifier,
.Fi n 
is determined with either
.Fr m_setevent
 using the 
.B %w
option,
or with
.Fr m_getinfo
\&.
In general, the window id
.Fi n
is the process id (\c
.I pid )
of the client program started by \*M
when the window was created.
If the target window has turned on
.SM
.B ACCEPT
.LG
with
.Fr m_setevent

as part of the
.SM
.B ACCEPT

.Fs m_setesc 3 "Change the character cursor representation"
The character cursor may be set to one of
CS_BLOCK, CS_LEFT, CS_RIGHT, CS_BOX, CS_UNDER, or CS_INVIS which 
sets the cursor representation to a solid block (the default), 
a verticle bar at the left edge of the character cell, a verticle bar at
the right edge, an outline box, or an underscore respectively.  CS_INVIS, 
or any other invalid code causes the character cursor to be invisible.
This macro currently only effects the cursor representation for the 
active window.
.Fe
.Fh m_setesc c
.Fs m_setesc 1 "Change the \*M escape character (for debugging)"
This macro call causes the character
.Fi c
to be used as the \*M
escape character by the library package (instead of 
.I '\e033' ).
This permits viewing
the output stream to \*M without causing the commands to
be executed.
.Fe
.Fh m_setecho
.Fs m_setecho 1 "Turn on terminal character echo"
Turn on character echoing, if possible.
Character echoing is normally disabled by clients to inhibit information

.Fh m_setevent n string
.Fs m_setevent 9 "Set an event"
An event string,
.Fi string
is sent to the client program by \*M upon the

.Fh m_setmode mode
.Fs m_setmode 6 "Set a window mode"
Various window modes may be
.I set
or
.I cleared
(see
.Fr m_clearmode
)
independently.
These modes are:
.RS
.IP \fBM_STANDOUT\fP 0.5i
The window is put in standout mode.
All characters
are written with their foreground and background
colors reversed.
.IP \fBM_WOB\fP 0.5i
The sense of
.I white
and
.I black
is reversed for the entire window,
not just for characters as is
.SM
.B M_STANDOUT .
.LG
.IP \fBM_AUTOEXPOSE\fP 0.5i
The next character to be typed on the window
causes it to automatically become the
.I active
window.
.IP \fBM_BACKGROUND\fP 0.5i
Output goes to the window even if it is 
partially or totally obscured.
The data in exposed portions of the window is seen immediately.
Data in covered portions of the window is saved by \*M and restored 
when the covered portions are exposed.
.IP \fBM_NOINPUT\fP 0.5i
Keyboard input is prohibited.
All input from
the keyboard is held buffered by \*M until
either
.SM
.B M_NOINPUT
.LG
is cleared, or a different
window is made the
.I active
window.
In the latter case
the input goes to the newly activated
window.
This flag is automatically turned
off when the user activates the window.
This feature is for client programs that want one of their
windows to come to the front just long enough to notify the
user of some event, but do not want to accidently intercept keyboard
input while the user is merrily typing to some other client.
.IP \fBM_NOWRAP\fP 0.5i
The character cursor does not automatically jump to the left edge of
the next line as it reaches the right edge of its text region.
After the right margin is passed,
the cursor and any subsequent text disappear past the right
edge of the window.
.IP \fBM_OVERSTRIKE\fP 0.5i
Text is written to the window with the mode
specified by
.Fr m_func
 instead of the normal
copy mode.
In copy mode, the characters completely obliterate their destination
instead of combining with it.
.IP \fBM_ABS\fP 0.5i
.br
The window is set to 
.I absolute
coordinate mode.
The upper left edge of the window, just inside
the border is at position
.Fr "" 0  0
\&.
All other locations
are measured relative to that corner in pixels.
.IP \fBM_ACTIVATE\fP 0.5i
The window is made the
.I active
window,  pops to the front of the display,
and obtains all keyboard and mouse input.
.IP \fBM_SNARFLINES\fP 0.5i
The system
.I cut
function only
cuts entire lines.
If any text on a line is swept out, the entire line of text
is included.
.IP \fBM_SNARFTABS\fP 0.5i
The system
.I cut
function attempts to turn
white space into a minimal combination of spaces and tabs.
Tab are set at every 8 columns.
.IP \fBM_SNARFHARD\fP 0.5i
The system
.I cut
function attempts to cut
text even if the window contents have been corrupted.
Unidentifyable characters are returned as
.I C_NOCHAR
(\'?\').
.IP \fBM_STACK\fP 0.5i
Any events pushed on the window stack
when this flag is set will be sent in addition to
any currently active events. 
This setting is useful for filters which need to receive events, yet
still permit clients running under them to receive events as well.
.RE
.Fe
.Fh m_setnoecho
.Fs m_setnoecho 1 "Turn off character echo"
Character echoing to the window is disabled if possible.
Character echoing is normally disabled by clients to inhibit information
from \*M, as from calls to 
.Fr m_getinfo
 from echoing on the window.
.Fe
.Fh m_setnoraw
.Fs m_setnoraw 1 "Enable normal character input processing (line mode)"
Normal terminal input processing is in effect.
Input is buffered by lines, and all normal line editting
and keyboard interrupt generation
is in effect.
.Fe
.Fh m_setraw
.Fs m_setraw 1 "Disable all character input processing (raw mode)"
Every character is available as entered, no input processing is 
done.
This is typically called
.I raw
mode.
Raw mode is not always available, in which case the macro call is
ignored.
.Fe
.Fh m_shapewindow X Y Dwidth Dheight
.Fs m_shapewindow 6 "Reposition a window"
The window is reshaped to
position
.Fr "" X Y
 and with size
.Fi Dwidth
by
.Fi Dheight .
As only the
.I active
window may be reshaped,
.Fr m_shapewindow
activates the window if it is not already active.
The new size of the window is not guaranteed;
the
.I width
or
.I height
may be truncated to the right or bottom edges of the display.
The macro
.Fr m_getinfo
can be used to determine the actual window size.
.Fe
.Fh m_size columns rows
.Fs m_size 6 "Resize a window to a specified number of rows and columns"
The size of the window is changed so that it fits exactly
.Fi columns
by
.Fi rows
of characters in the current font.
The window may be truncated at the right or bottom edge of the display
if it is too large to fit on the display at its current position.
.Fe
.Fh m_sizeall X Y columns rows
.Fs m_sizeall 6 "Reposition a window with a given number of rows and columns"
The window is reshaped to position
.Fr "" X Y
 on the display, and resized to fit
.Fi columns
and
.Fi rows
of text.
As only the
.I active
window may be reshaped,
.Fr m_shapewindow
 activates the window if it is not already active.
The new size of the window is not guaranteed;
the
.I width
or
.I height
may be truncated to the right or bottom edges of the display.
The macro 
.Fr m_getinfo
can be used to determine the actual window size.
.Fe
.Fh m_snarf
.Fs m_snarf 12 "Retrieve the contents of the global snarf buffer"
The application is sent the contents of the global snarf buffer,
if any, as specified by the last call by a client programs
call to
.Fr m_put
 or by use of the system
.I cut
function.
.Fe
.Fh m_sleep
.Fs m_sleep 13 "Do nothing"
This call causes \*M to suspend the processing
of characters to the window.
After a chunk of output for all other windows has been processed,
output processing resumes.
This does not normally take very long, making
.Fr m_sleep
 almost a 
.I no-op.
.Fe
.Fh m_standend
.Fs m_standend 3 "Turn off reverse video characters"
Inverse video mode as set by
.Fr m_standout
 is turned off.
This is exactly equivalent to
.Fr m_clearmode M_STANDOUT
\&.
.Fe
.Fh m_standout
.Fs m_standout 3 "Turn on reverse video characters"
Inverse video mode is turned on.
This is exactly equivalent to
.Fr m_setmode M_STANDOUT
\&.
The color of the characters and their backgrounds are interchanged.
.Fe
.Fh m_stringto to x_dst y_dst string
.Fs m_stringto 4 "Print a string to an scratchpad bitmap"
The text
.Fi string
is printed
starting at the location
.Fr "" x_dst y_dst
 on 
.I scratchpad
bitmap
.Fi to .
The text is clipped to fit in the bitmap, and no special command processing
is done on
.Fi string.
If 
.Fi to
is 0 (zero),
The text is printed on the window, but
.I "text region"
boundaries are ignored.
This is the only way to get text into a window outside of the
.I "text region" .
.Fe
.Fh m_textregion x y wide high
.Fs m_textregion 3 "create a text region"
A subregion within the current window
starting at
.Fr "" x y
 and of size
.Fi wide
by
.Fi high
is defined within which all text is restricted.
All functions and information that deals in
.I character
coordinates views the text region as if it was the entire window.
As soon as the text region is defined, the character cursor is
moved to row and column
.Fr "" 0 0
,
which is now located at the point
.Fr "" x y
\&.
Graphics output is not affected by text regions.
.Fe
.Fh m_textreset
.Fs m_textreset 3 "Reset the text region to the entire window"
The
.I "text region"
(defined by a call to
.Fr m_textregion
) is reset to be the entire window.
This is the default setting.
.Fe
.Fh m_unlinkmenu parent item
.Fs m_unlinkmenu 8 "Unlink a menu"
The menu link associating a child menu with
the menu
.Fi parent
at
.Fi item
(counting from zero) is removed
(see also
.Fr m_linkmenu
\&).
This function does not change the menus, only their
connections.
.Fe
.Fh m_unpagemenu parent
.Fs m_unpagemenu 8 "Disconnect two pages of a paged menu"
The link associating the menu
.Fi parent
with a
.I child
menu is removed.

.Fh m_whatsat X Y
.Fs m_whatsat 7 "Find out what is at a particular display location"
\*M returns to the client program a line indicating what is at the
.I display
coordinates
.Fr "" X Y
\&.
If that location is occupied by a window,
a line containing the window's controlling terminal, alternate window number,
and
.I "window id"
is returned in a space separated list.
If the location
.Fr "" X Y
 is not in a window, \*M returns a newline.
.Fe
.Fh m_windowsave name
.Fs m_windowsave 5 "Save the window image on a file"
The current image contents of the window is saved in the file
