.Fh m_font n
.Fs m_font 6 "Change to a new font"
Change to font
.Fi n .
The line positioning is adjusted to keep
the baseline of the new and old fonts the same.
Font numbers are small integers
(currently no more than 15).
Font 0 (zero) always refers to the built-in or
.I default
font.
The actual fonts associated with the font numbers may be set in the \*M
.I startup
file, or changed by clients on the fly
(see
.Fr m_loadfont
).
.Fe
.Fh m_func mode 
.Fs m_func 4 "Set the bit-blt and graphics drawing mode"
.Fs m_func 5 "Set the bit-blt function"
Set the drawing mode.
This specifies the drawing mode for all
.I graphics
and
.I bit-blt
operations.
The integer
.Fi mode
is one of 16 possible boolean combinations of
the
.I source
and
.I destination
bit patterns.
Combinations of bit patterns for which
there is no
.I source
bitmap, such as
.Fr m_bitwrite
 or
.Fr m_line
 use the modes shown in the middle column of the following table.
Several common
.Fi mode s
are specified for the bit patterns in which the source
bitmap is relevent.

Alternately,
.Fi mode
may be derived with a boolean combination of

.Fh m_getchar
.Fs m_getchar 2 "Read a character from \*M"
The macro

except the character is retrieved from \*M via the file pointer
.I m_termin
instead of
.I stdin.
.Fe
.Fh m_gets buff 
.Fs m_gets 2 "Read a line from \*M"
A line of characters is read from \*M and placed into
.Fi buff .
The macro

returns
.SM
.I NULL
.LG
if the connection to \*M is severed.
The macro

.Fe
.Fh m_getinfo mode 
.Fs m_getinfo 7 "Ask \*M for information"
This function requests \*M to return information back to the client program.
.Fi Mode
specifies one of (currently) 16 different requests.
Responses are always terminated with a 
.I "new line"
for single line responses, and with a pair of
.I "new lines"
for multi-line
responses.
Consequently, clients can request and process information requests
using normal line mode processing.
The following list of information requests is understood.
.RS
'\"	.IP \fBG_ALLFONT\fP 0.5i	Size information for all fonts.
'\"	.br
'\"	The

'\"	separated list.
'\"	The first pair of numbers is the character size of font
'\"	.B 0 ,
'\"	the next pair for font
'\"	.B 1 ,
'\"	and so on.
'\"	The first request for
'\"	.Fi G_ALLFONT
'\"	can be expensive, as it requires reading each font
'\"	from the disk that has not yet been used.
.IP \fBG_ALLMINE\fP 0.5i
Window status for alternate windows.
.br
Information about each window that may be written to by the client program
is returned, one line of information per window, as a 
list of space separated items.
The first two items give the location of the top left
corner of the window in
.I display
coordinates.
The second two items give the 
.I height
and
.I width
of the window, 
also in
.I display
coordinates.
The next field contains the last two characters of the
.I pseudo tty
associated with each window.
Normally the 
.I pseudo tty
is the same for each window reported.
The next field contains the 
.I "window id" ,
which is 0 (zero)
for the primary window, 
and the value returned by the call to 
.Fr m_makewindow
for the other windows (if any).
The final field contains the visual status of the window,
which is either 
.SM
.I C_EXPOSED
.LG
('e')
if the window is completely visible,
or
.SM
.I C_OBSCURED
.LG
('o')
if the window is partly or completely obscured.
The window information is printed in order from
.I front
to 
.I back .
A sample line might look something like:
.TS
center box;
c.

.Fi 2,
and is at least partially obscured.
.IP \fBG_ALL\fP 0.5i
Status of all windows.
.br
Information about all windows
is returned, one line of information per window, as a
list of space separated items.
The first two items give the location of the top left
corner of the window in
.I display
coordinates.
The second two items give the 
.I height
and
.I width
of the window, 
also in
.I display
coordinates.
The next field contains the last two characters of the
.I pseudo tty
associated with each window.
Normally the 
.I pseudo tty
is the same for each window controlled by the same client.
The next field contains the 
.I "window id" ,
which is 0 (zero)
for a primary window, 
and the value returned by the call to 
.Fr m_makewindow
for alternate windows.
The final field contains the visual status of the window,
which is either 
.SM
.I C_EXPOSED
.LG
('e')
if the window is completely visible,
or
.SM
.I C_OBSCURED
.LG
('o')
if the window is partly or completely obscured.
The window information for each window is printed in order from
.I front
to 
.I back.
Thus the first line returned is currently the
.I active
window.
A sample line might look something like:
.TS
center box;
c.

in window coordinates.
The graphics cursor location is reported in either
.I absolute
or
.I relative
window coordinates,
depending upon the window coordinate mode setting.
.IP \fBG_FONT\fP 0.5i
Current font information.
.br
A single line is returned which contains current font information.
The first pair of numbers is the character
.I width
and
.I height,
in pixels.
The next number is the
.I "font number"
as would be used in a call to
.Fi m_font ,
and the final field is the ascii name of the font.
.IP \fBG_ID\fP 0.5i
Alternate window number.
.br
A single line is returned containing the window's alternate window
id ( 0 for the main window), 
followed by the number of windows controlled by the client 
program.
.IP \fBG_MOUSE\fP 0.5i
Mouse coordinates.
.br
The mouse position, in 
.I display 
coordinates are returned, followed by the most recent button transition,
which is one of
.Fi 1 , -1 , 2 , -2 .
The numbers
.Fi 1
and
.Fi 2
represent buttons
.I one
and
.I two
on the mouse respectively.
The third mouse button is reserved for system use and is not accessible to
client programs.
A negative value means the button was released;
a positive value indicates the button is still depressed.
.IP \fBG_MOUSE2\fP 0.5i
Scaled mouse coordinates.
.br
The mouse coordinates, in 
.I window 
coordinates are returned, followed by the most recent button transition,
which is one of
.Fi 1 , -1 , 2 , -2 .
The numbers
.Fi 1
and
.Fi 2
represent buttons
.I one
and
.I two
respectively.
A negative value means the button was last released;
a positive value indicates the button is still depressed.
If the 
mouse is above
or to the left of the window,
a negative coordinate value is returned.
In addition if the window is in
.I relative
coordinate mode, coordinate values between
0 and 999 will be reported only if the mouse is within the window.
.IP \fBG_STATUS\fP 0.5i
Window status.
.br
A line is returned containing a single character,
either
