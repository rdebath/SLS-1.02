	  and msdso makefile
Tue Oct 20 Patchlevel 59 Mike McGann (mwm@hssler.ascom.ch)
	* binbookfile is now the main form of book.

	* add caching for static evaluations
	* add aging for in core transposition table
	* changes to history killer from tietz@eos.informatik.uni-bonn.de (Benno Tietz)

	* prevent caching of partially evalusted positions.
	* add game time control
	* add capability to feed back the clock for ICS  play
	* gnuan fix en-passant problem
	* gnuchess make book nameable in command line
	* change move output to generate o-o form of castling moves
	  to satisfy ICS
	* Speedup evaluation functions
	* fixes to killt from tietz@eos.informatik.uni-bonn.de (Benno Tietz)
	* add moves generated to post output
        * fixes to genmoves from Dan Oetting <oetting@gldfs.cr.usgs.gov>
	* change over to gettimeofday for more accuracy
	* clean up search logic and time control
	* fix transposition search bug
Mon Aug 24 Patchlevel 58 Mike McGann (mwm@hssler.ascom.ch)
	* add Mwpawn, Mbpawn, Mw..., Mb... , p and debug commands to
	gnuchessr. 
	* Fix bug in evaluation logic for hung pieces.
	* Fix time control calculation to add time at time control
Fri Aug 14 Patchlevel 57 Ben Hurwitz (bug fixes) Thierry Leconte (book)
	* Both/force interaction improved.
	* Bug fix to possibles declaration and OR of move with BADMOVE
	* Work better with GM John Nunn book (take care of order of
	  lines, don't null the book for at least 3 moves after taken out
	  of book, no random opening)
	* Removed exit of program when drawn game detected.
	* Fixed bug that caused program to make 1-move blunders.
	  (transposition table caused return 0 when position seen before
	   to detect draw which then gets a depth bonus since search
	   is inexact so it ends up looking better to make a repetition
	   than making a winning 1-mover!)
Sun Jul 2 Patchlevel 56 Henrik Schmiediche
	* Fix test command (patch to dspcom.c). The results
	  were off by a factor of 100.
	* Delete lint from Makefile.
	* Better CFLAGS for HP machine.
Mon Jun 29 Patchlevel 55 Stuart Cracraft
	* Apply Mann's FIONREAD-clarification patches
	* Change BOOKFAIL in gnuchess.h so that the program
	  always consults the opening book first.
	* Up BOOKBITS to 10 to account for larger book:
  "As currently set up with BOOKBITS equal 8 there is a table of 256
  pointers into the BOOK hashtable. With 20,000 entries and 256 buckets
  it would do a linear search of approx 78 entries per lookup. Increasing
  BOOKBITS to 9 would mean a search of 34 entries etc. and would add 
  256 pointers to the data area. So we probably should make it 10 then."
						McGann
Fri Jun 26 Patchlevel 54 Mike McGann
	* This version compiles into a version identical with
	  3.1+ (and so is much stronger than the previous 4.0).
	  But, it has beaten 3.1+ in a short match. Also, it
	  has bug fixes, timing control improvements and other
	  fixes contained in this list.
Tue Jun 23 Patchlevel 53  Stuart Cracraft / Tim Mann
	* Use a[u]+1 in ataks.c instead of ++a[u].
	* Don't use space bonus tables.
Tue Jun 23 Patchlevel 52  Tom Truscott
	* GNUchess will now compile on the IBM RS/6000 (AIX).
	* Makefile changes needed for older AIX compilers lacking support
	  for "cc -c foo.c -o bar.o" (strange but true).
	* The other changes are to appease the picky type checking
	  that is enabled by some of the compiler options.
Sat Jun 21 Patchlevel 51  Tim Mann <mann@src.dec.com>
	* Fixed problem with "help" command by removing "fflush(stdin)".
	* "Undo" command now does not add moves to a 1-move time control.
	* Added back feature from 3.1 that lets the user set a maximum
	  search time per move instead of using time controls, and changed
	  the command line syntax for this feature to be compatible with 3.1,
	  removing the ability to set max search depth from the command line.
        * Fixed the "maximum minutes per move" feature in gnuan.
	* Updated and corrected the man page.
Thu Jun 18 Patchlevel 50 Tim Mann
	* Special #ifdefs to not do post for xboard are unnecessary

	* Encapsulate Xboard with GNU Chess distribution
Sun May 31 Patchlevel 44 Bart Massey (bart@cs.uoregon.edu)
	* Rename structure element move to bmove in book.c since
	  curses.h defines a move macro.
	* Get rid of superfluous returns in dspcom.c and checkbook.c
	* Be sure beep message has an arg in uxdsp.c
	* Add exit status to exit() call in checkbook.c
Sat May 30 Patchlevel 43 Stuart Cracraft (cracraft@rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)
	* Fix checkmate/draw handling.
	* Add current module copyrights and COPYING.
	* Ifdef forced-mate announcements as too buggy.
Fri May 29 Patchlevel 42 Stuart Cracraft (cracraft@rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)
	* HUNGP/HUNGX in eval.c updated to values used by Slate/Atkin
	  of Chess 4.x. This fixes a problem with Reinfeld's #281
	  and poor play in Alapin's opening. General play against
	  me has been much better.
Mon May 11 Patchlevel 41 Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	* genmove update to look at less possible promotion moves

Sun Oct 5 13:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	* patchlevel 12
	* Change eval.c/KingValue to ignore Mking if the otherside
	has only pawns on the board. Tuning parameter is
	KINGPOSLIMIT.
	
	* Fix time print in gnuchess and gnuchessx. 

	* Use ShowMessage for all error messages.

	* Fix post option to print time in seconds.

Sun Oct 5 08:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)

	* speedups in search. Eliminate unused computation.

	* change eval.c/KingValue to ignore Mking if there are
	only pawns on the board. Tuning Parameter is KINGPOSLIMIT.

	* make DITHER a tuning parameter.

Tue Oct 1 08:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	* patchlevel 10
	* fix eval bug in ScorePosition. Evaluated pawn structute
	incorrectly. Introduced when gnuchess was split up.

	* Change default for SCORETIME to -9000 it plays better

	* correct promotion logic for CHESSTOOL and XBOARD only queens
	are generated now.

	* correct handling of TOflag for bothsides mode.

Mon Sept 27 08:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	* fix more enpassant bugs in checkgame/checkbook

	* misc speedups by inlining code.
	move SqAtakd to ataks.h and inline it.
	
	* Modify checkbook to also read xboard game files and
	check them for illegal moves. 
	
	* fix bug in game.c introduced by patch 8

Mon Sept 26 08:34:00 1991  Urban Koistinen (md85-epi@nada.kth.se) 

	* Correct the making and unmaking of enpassant moves and
	numerous incorrect usages of ? throughout the program.

Mon Sept 24 08:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)

	* force search re-init if PV chavges due to a timeout

	* add patchlevel to the -v option to keep version straight.
	
	* Change search and timing logic. Search now backs up to
	previous level on a timeout. Search adds time to the search
	if the last top level PV is different from the current and
	this level is not finished. Seems to play much stronger.

Mon Sept 16 08:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	
	* Opening book now handles transitions. It continues looking
	at the book until 2 (tunable) successive turns fail to find a move
	there.

	* GetOpenings now checks for errors on input. The current book was full 
	of illegal moves. They were filtered out since at game time the book
	move is matched against the legal move list. But it makes for bad
	opening play. EnPassant moves are not allowed in openings(a limitation?)
	Checks made are the there is a piece on the from square belonging
	to the right side and there is no piece or a piece belonging to the
	other side on the to square. There is no check that the piece is 
	moving legally.
	
	* ListGame now makes up the name chess.lst.random#. So if you are
	using xboard to play a match (two machine mode) they won't overwrite.
	
	* Added patch from Randy Ray (rray@SPECLAB.CR.USGS.GOV) to correctly
	format chess.lst

Wed Sept 4 08:34:00 1991  Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	
	* Renamed gnuchess3.1+ to gnuchess to reflect the split in 
	gnuchess development. There now seems to be 3 threads.
	Gnuchess, gnuchess for windows (3.21), and the gnuchess4
	project if it still exists.
	* Fix chesstool version to handle white as well as black.
	* Split program into modules for easier maintinance and
	development.
	* Fixed Illegal move bug in VerifyMove for promotion moves.
	* Replaced ResponseTime calculations with simpler version that
	stays within the time limits and seems to do as well or better
	in play.
	* General cleanup of the search algorithm
	* Fixed gnuan input processing and termination code.
	* Fixes to work with xboard match mode
	* Added TEST directory with 16 problems from Levy's
	  Computer Chess book.

Tue Aug  6 18:10:47 1991  Philippe Schnoebelen  (phs@lifia.imag.fr)

	* Modify handling of Book in Undo (previously, when you
	backtracked after quitting the book, the program was not able to
	use it again)

	* Modify handling of Book in EditBoard and other routines so that
	the Book is not used if you don't start from the regular initial board.

Mon Aug  5 17:26:59 1991  Philippe Schnoebelen  (phs@lifia.imag.fr)

	* Modify parse in gnuchess.c so that a move can be followed by '?'
	indicating that the program should not play it itself. Such a move
	is stored with the highest bit raised.
          Modify OpeningBook in gnuchess.c so that moves with highest bit
	set are recognized but not played by the program.

	* Modify the declaration of array PieceList in gnuchess.[ch] to
	allow for up to 64 men of the same side. Such artificial
	situations can be built with edit and the program must be able to
	deal with them.

Mon Aug 1 10:20 1991 Mike McGann (mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	Split chesstool and xboard versions. Xboard is now
	gnuchessx and chesstool is gnuchessc.

Mon Apr 15 10:20 1991 Mike McGann {mwm@hslrswi.hasler.ascom.ch)
	Changed transposition table to cache positions found in transposition file
	Fix Undo's incorrect handling of promotions.
	Fix win and draw determination bugs.
 	Fix bug in algbr that prevented correct display of promotion moves.
	Fix Undo to correctly display side to move.
	Add path to command line for save file and load file.
	Make save file human readable
	
Thu May 24 13:42:24 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at baloo)
	* Fixed a bug reported by Brian Wong (wong@cs.UAlberta.CA) in
	ScoreKPK

Sat May  5 15:58:31 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at baloo)
	* extensive tests on MSDOS for 2 weeks and lots of changes:
	Moved all flags to a special flag structure.
	Added my own TODO file to the DOCUMENTATION.
	Moved GetOpenings and parse from the *dsp.c files.
	Made the transposition table enabled by default.
	Some cleanup in the *dsp.c code.
	Changed UpdateHashbd to a macro.

Wed Apr 18 16:38:30 1990  Hans-Erik Sandstr|m  (hes at tiamat)
	* Removed unnessesary global variables:
	(wking, bking, Enemyking, INCscore, slk, InChk, HasPawn,
	Zwmtl, Zbmtl, lpost, KBNKsq) this should make the program more
	readable.
	* Added a mini transposition table to detect repetitions, this
	means that repetition is called more seldom and should save some
	time. The idea for this came from Benno Tietz
	(tietz@eos.informatik.uni-bonn.de)

Thu Mar 29 02:49:00 1990  Thorsten Ohl at (td12@ddagsi3.bitnet)
     * nuxdsp.c has been given an ANSI interface (tailored
	after uxdsp.c as of Version 3.00 and a homegrown
	ANSI interface created in January for Version 1.55).
     *	uxdsp.c now understands ^C interrupts.
     *	both nuxdsp.c and uxdsp.c support the graphic characters
	of the IBM PC (can be disabled with -DSEVENBIT).
	It's of course a matter of taste, but I think it looks
	much better.
     * I have added prototypes and a makefile for a **IX compatible
	MS-DOS make (neither Turbo C or Microsoft C will understand
	this!).
     *	some formal parameters are not referenced. This is due to the
	different display interfaces and no problem at all. Just for
	aesthetic reasons I have shut up the compiler by incrementing
	the unreferenced variables.
     *	some longs are assigned to shorts and some shorts to unsigned chars.
	I have introduced a cast in each case, all are o.k. (as far
	as I can tell).

Thu Mar  8 09:11:28 1990  Hans-Erik Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa1)
	* The persistent hash table seems to work now. There are still some
	problems using it on a heterogenous network.

Sun Mar  4 14:44:44 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa)
	* I am working on a persistent hash table. Currenly a 10Mb file
	with 262144 entrys. Stuart just asked me to spilt the posdata
	array to make gnuchess work better on a PC, so I did that.
	I have also tried to properly fix the bug that caused gnuchess
	to report mate prematurely. This, I hope, will also improve the
	search.

Tue Feb 27 18:27:23 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at davidson.log-sv.se)
	* used protoize to make a function prototyped version of gnuchess.
	this means that I have to use unprotoize before 'make distribution'
	to make a more portable K&R version.
	removed a ZeroTTable so now the hashtable is kept between moves.

Sat Feb 24 13:14:14 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa)
	* Added a test to detect hash table collisions, define HASHTEST.
	I also removed 	the times calls since there is no sense in
	measuring cpu time when	wallclock time is all that counts when
	playing chess.

Fri Feb 23 17:25:37 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa)
	* Compiled gnuchess with gcc1.37 -Wall and got lots of
	implicit decaration warnings. Solved most of these by adding
	external declarations in gnuchess.h.

Wed Feb 21 17:41:28 1990 Jouko Holopainen (jhol@tolsun.oulu.fi) 
	* Contributed his code for ECO move entry (again!)
	and a file ansidsp.c (A msdos port of uxdsp.c).
	I(hes) started a merge of ansidsp.c and uxdsp.c.

February 8, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Changed the transpositon table to allow 65536 positions per player.
	This means a 1.3 Mbyte hash table. Introduced simple rehashing. And
	also made setting ttable 0 exclude all transposition code from
	gnuchess (for machines with very little memory).


February 3, 1990 -- Tom Vijlbrief (tnosoes!tom@nluug.n)
	Contributed code to fix undo of promotions.
	And a bugfix RMBLTY was to small.


Januari 27, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Fixed nuxdsp.c to work with my changes (Saved games format)


Januari 26, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Verified that the underpromotion routines works.
	Found and fixed the bug that caused gnuchess to report mate
	and draw prematurely.


Januari 25, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Received the underpromotion additions from jhol@tolsun.oulu.fi
	Made some optimizations in trapped and KingScan.
	Added more comments on how to improve the search.
	Added info on usage of the array Tree in post mode.
	Changed the index in the transposition table to unsigned short to
	allow a hash table of size 65536.


Januari 11, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Formatted gnuchess according to GNU standards with indent.


Januari 9, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Inserted a missing comma in KTHRT.
	Removed mvstr1[5],mvstr2[5] from gnuchess.c, they are only used in the
	user-interface routines uxdsp.c nondsp.c anyway.
	Rewrote algbr to generate move strings for underpromotion.
	(ph8k or h7h8k)
	Some optimizations in CaptureList.
	Changed row, column and locn to macros.
	Made memset default and introduced a switch NOMEMSET for
	computers without memset or where memset is a speed penality.
	I tested this on:
		Sparc		- no change
		DECstation	- no change
		Sun3/60		- 4% speed improvment.
	Changed + to | in some bit-field manipulations.
