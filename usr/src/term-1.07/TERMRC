#The format of the ~/.term/termrc file.
#All blank lines, and line begining with a '#' are ignored.
#All command words must be in lowercase.
#valid lines are... 

#compress off
# To turn of compression. Useful for compressing modems
# No benchmarks have been done to see which does better compression,
# modems, or term. See OPTIONS to compression compression on/off on
# a per client basis.

#escape 158
# tells term never to transmit character with decimal number
# 158. Use the ouput of checkline to find out what to put
# here. Valid number are anything between 32 and 255
# Use one line for each character.
# ranges are valid. I.e. "escape 128-159"

escape 0-31
escape 128-159
# the above are some handy escapes that will cause most lines to work.
# but they are very inefficent (they escape 25% of all bytes sent!!!)
# so try and escape as few as possible.


baudrate 38400
# Sets the baudrate. Actually used to limit the maximum
# number of characters sent per second.
# valid numbers are anything >= 2400. Default is zero.

#shift 224
# Sets a 'shift' value. This number is XOR'ed with
# all bytes before they are sent.  This is in a bid to
# reduce the number of escaped characters sent. Histograms
# show that 224-255 has the least number of characters sent
# and 0-31 has the most. This should improve things. The
# default is zero for backward compatability.

#flowcontrol 500
# Tell term to generate control-Q's everynow and then
# used in case your terminal server understands flow control
# and things will accidently turn it off. i.e. line noise
# sends a control-S.

#window 3
# Set the maximum number of packets that can be outstanding
# useful values are around 2-6.

#timeout 50
# sets the length of time to wait before retransmitting a 
# packet. If useing a large window size, then increase this
# value. A smaller window sizes merits a smaller timeout 
# value. If getting too many re-transmits, then increase.
# measured in 1/20th's of a second. 

#force on
# Turn transmit forceing on.

noise on
# Turn on printing out line noise.

#sevenbit
# If were are running on a 7 bit line..

#seven_in
# If your incoming line is seven bit.
# Note that these are symetric. If you have seven_in on one end, you MUST
# have seven_out on the other.

#seven_out
# If your outgoing line is seven bit. "seven_in" and "seven_out" together
# are the same as "sevenbit".


ignore 17
# Silently strip the character 17 from the input stream.

ignore 19
# ditto.

# breakout 24
# set the breakout character to be control-X. So five control-X's types
# to term will cause it to exit.

# chdir /usr/users/oreillym
# Make the default directory usr/users/oreillym (my home dir).
