                Implementation Notes for CLISP
                ==============================

This implementation is mostly compatible to the standard reference

       Guy L. Steele Jr.: Common Lisp - The Language (1st ed.).
       Digital Press 1984.
       (CLtL1 for short)


These notes document the differences of the CLISP implementation of Common
Lisp to the standard CLtL1, and some implementation details.


                      CHAPTER 1: Introduction
                      -----------------------

No notes.


                       CHAPTER 2: Data Types
                       ---------------------

All the data types are implemented: numbers, characters, symbols, lists,
arrays, hash tables, readtables, packages, pathnames, streams, random
states, structures and functions.

2.1.3.
------

There are four floating point types: short-float, single-float, double-float
and long-float:
                  sign    mantissa   exponent
   short-float    1 bit   16+1 bits   8 bits
   single-float   1 bit   23+1 bits   8 bits   CLISP uses IEEE format
   double-float   1 bit   52+1 bits  11 bits   CLISP uses IEEE format
   long-float     1 bit   >=64 bits  32 bits

The single and double float formats are those of the IEEE standard (1981),
except that CLISP does not support features like +0, -0, +inf, -inf, gradual
underflow, NaN, etc. (Common Lisp does not make use of these features.)

Long floats have variable mantissa length, which is a multiple of 16 (or 32,
depending on the word size of the processor). The default length used when
long floats are read is given by the place (LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS). It can be
set by (SETF (LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS) nnn), where nnn is a positive integer.

2.1.4.
------

Complex numbers can have a real part and an imaginary part of different
types. For example, (SQRT -9.0) evaluates to the number #C(0 3.0), which has
a real part of exactly 0, not only 0.0 (which would mean "approximately 0").
The type specifier for this is (COMPLEX INTEGER SINGLE-FLOAT), and

           (COMPLEX type-of-real-part type-of-imaginary-part)

in general.
The type specifier (COMPLEX type) is equivalent to (COMPLEX type type).

2.2.1.
------

The characters are ordered according to the ASCII encoding.

More precisely, CLISP uses the IBM PC character set (code page 437):
             $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9 $A $B $C $D $E $F
         $00 **                   ** ** ** ** ** ** **  ∂  ß
         $10                               ** **            
         $20     !  "  #  $  %  &  '  (  )  *  +  ,  -  .  /
         $30  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  :  ;  <  =  >  ?
         $40  @  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O
         $50  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  [  \  ]  ^  _
         $60  `  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o
         $70  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z  {  |  }  ~  
         $80  «  ¸  È  ‚  ‰  ‡  Â  Á  Í  Î  Ë  Ô  Ó  Ï  ƒ  ≈
         $90  …  Ê  ∆  Ù  ˆ  Ú  ˚  ˘  ˇ  ÷  ‹  ¢  £  •      
         $A0  ·  Ì  Û  ˙  Ò  —  ™  ∫  ø     ¨  Ω  º  °  ´  ª
         $B0                                                
         $C0                                                
         $D0                                                
         $E0     ﬂ              µ                           
         $F0     ±              ˜     ∞     ∑        ≤      
Here ** are control characters, not graphic characters. (The characters left
blank here cannot be represented in this character set).

The following are standard characters:
  #\Space               $20
  #\Newline             $0A
The following are semi-standard characters:
  #\Backspace           $08
  #\Tab                 $09
  #\Linefeed            $0A
  #\Page                $0C
  #\Return              $0D
  #\Rubout              $08

2.2.2.
------

#\Newline is the delimiter between lines.

When writing to a file, #\Newline is converted to CR/LF. (This is the usual
convention on ATARI and DOS.) For example, #\Return #\Newline is written as
CR/CR/LF.
When reading from a file, CR/LF is converted to #\Newline, and CR not
followed by LF is read as #\Return.

2.2.3.
------

There are the following additional characters with names:
  #\Null                $00
  #\Bell                $07
  #\Escape              $1B

2.2.4.
------

The code of a character is >=0, <256. CHAR-CODE-LIMIT = 256.

There are fonts 0 to 15, and CHAR-FONT-LIMIT = 16. But the system itself
uses only font 0.

The following bits attributes are implemented: :CONTROL, :META, :SUPER,
:HYPER. Therefore CHAR-BITS-LIMIT = 16.
The system itself uses these bits only to mention special keys and
Control/Alternate/Shift key status on return from
(READ-CHAR *KEYBOARD-INPUT*).

2.5.
----

The maximum rank (number of dimensions) of an array is 65535 on 16-bit
processors, 4294967295 on 32-bit processors.

2.13.
-----

All the functions built by FUNCTION, COMPILE and the like are atoms. There
are built-in functions written in C, compiled functions (both of type
COMPILED-FUNCTION) and interpreted functions (of type FUNCTION).
The possible function names (CLtL1 p. 59) are symbols and lambda expressions.

2.14.
-----

This is the list of objects whose external representation can not be
meaningfully read in:
  * all structures lacking a keyword constructor.
  * all arrays except strings, if *PRINT-ARRAY* = NIL.
  * #<SYSTEM-FUNCTION name>     built-in function written in C
  * #<SPECIAL-FORM name>        special form handler
  * #<COMPILED-CLOSURE name>    compiled function, if *PRINT-CLOSURE* = NIL
  * #<CLOSURE name ...>         interpreted function
  * #<FRAME-POINTER #x...>      pointer to a stack frame
  * #<DISABLED POINTER>         frame pointer which has become invalid on
                                exit from the corresponding BLOCK or TAGBODY
  * #<...-STREAM ...>           stream
  * #<PACKAGE name>             package
  * #<HASH-TABLE #x...>         hash table, if *PRINT-ARRAY* = NIL
  * #<READTABLE #x...>          readtable
  * #<UNBOUND>                  "value" of a symbol without value, "value"
                                of an unsupplied optional or keyword argument
  * #<SPECIAL REFERENCE>        environment marker for variables declared
                                SPECIAL
  * #<DOT>                      internal READ result for "."
  * #<END OF FILE>              internal READ result, when the end of file
                                is reached
  * #<READ-LABEL ...>           intermediate READ result for #n#
  * #<ADDRESS #x...>            machine address, should not occur
  * #<SYSTEM-POINTER #x...>     should not occur

The type NUMBER is the disjoint union of the types REAL and COMPLEX. (CLtL
wording: "exhaustive partition")
The type REAL is the disjoint union of the types RATIONAL and FLOAT.
The type RATIONAL is the disjoint union of the types INTEGER and RATIO.
The type INTEGER is the disjoint union of the types FIXNUM and BIGNUM.
The type FLOAT is the disjoint union of the types SHORT-FLOAT, SINGLE-FLOAT,
DOUBLE-FLOAT and LONG-FLOAT.


                     CHAPTER 3: Scope and Extent
                     ---------------------------

is implemented as described.


                      CHAPTER 4: Type Specifiers
                      --------------------------

4.5.
----

The general form of the COMPLEX type specifier is
(COMPLEX type-of-real-part type-of-imaginary-part).
The type specifier (COMPLEX type) is equivalent to (COMPLEX type type).

4.6.
----

The REAL type specifier (REAL low high) denotes the real numbers between low
and high.

4.7.
----

DEFTYPE lambda lists are subject to destructuring (nested lambda lists are
allowed, as in DEFMACRO) and may contain a &WHOLE marker, but no
&ENVIRONMENT marker.

4.9.
----

The possible results of TYPE-OF are:
 CONS
 SYMBOL NULL
 FIXNUM BIGNUM RATIO SHORT-FLOAT SINGLE-FLOAT DOUBLE-FLOAT LONG-FLOAT COMPLEX
 CHARACTER
 (ARRAY element-type dimensions), (SIMPLE-ARRAY element-type dimensions)
 (VECTOR T size), (SIMPLE-VECTOR size)
 (STRING size), (SIMPLE-STRING size)
 (BIT-VECTOR size), (SIMPLE-BIT-VECTOR size)
 FUNCTION COMPILED-FUNCTION
 STREAM PACKAGE HASH-TABLE READTABLE PATHNAME RANDOM-STATE
 BYTE LOAD-TIME-EVAL READ-LABEL FRAME-POINTER SYSTEM-INTERNAL
 ADDRESS (should not occur)
 any other symbol (structure types)


                       CHAPTER 5: program Structure
                       ----------------------------

5.1.3.
------

In addition to the 24 special forms listed on p. 57, the macros
PSETQ, PROG1, PROG2, WHEN, UNLESS, COND, MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST,
MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ, AND, OR
are implemented as special forms.

Constants may not be bound dynamically or lexically.

5.2.2.
------

LAMBDA-LIST-KEYWORDS =
    (&OPTIONAL &REST &KEY &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS &AUX &BODY &WHOLE &ENVIRONMENT)

LAMBDA-PARAMETERS-LIMIT is 65536 on 16-bit processors, 4294967296 on 32-bit
processors.

5.3.
----

DEFUN and DEFMACRO are allowed in non-toplevel positions.
As an example, consider the definition of GENSYM:
(let ((gensym-prefix "G")
      (gensym-count 1))
  (defun gensym (&optional (x nil s))
    (when s
      (cond ((stringp x) (setq gensym-prefix x))
            ((integerp x)
             (if (minusp x)
               (error "~S: index ~S is negative" 'gensym x)
               (setq gensym-count x)
            ))
            (t (error "~S: argument ~S of wrong type" 'gensym x))
    ) )
    (prog1
      (make-symbol
        (concatenate 'string
          gensym-prefix
          (write-to-string gensym-count :base 10 :radix nil)
      ) )
      (incf gensym-count)
) )

5.3.2.
------

(PROCLAIM '(SPECIAL var)) declarations may not be undone. The same holds
for DEFVAR, DEFPARAMETER and DEFCONSTANT declarations.

It is an error if a DEFCONSTANT variable is bound at the moment the
DEFCONSTANT is executed, but DEFCONSTANT does not check this.

Constants may not be bound dynamically or lexically.


                      CHAPTER 6: Predicates
                      ---------------------

6.2.2.
------

REALP returns T is its argument is a real number, NIL otherwise.

COMPILED-FUNCTION-P returns T on built-in functions written in C, compiled
functions and special form handlers. Therefore COMPILED-FUNCTION is not a
subtype of FUNCTION.

6.3.
----

EQ compares characters and fixnums as EQL does. No unnecessary copies are
made of characters and numbers. Nevertheless, one should use EQL.

(let ((x y)) (eq x x)) always returns T, regardless of y.

6.4.
----

AND and OR are implemented as special forms and, as such, rather efficient.


                      CHAPTER 7: Control Structure
                      ----------------------------

7.1.1.
------

(FUNCTION symbol) returns the local function definition established by FLET
or LABELS, if it exists, otherwise the global function definition.

(SPECIAL-FORM-P symbol) returns NIL or T. If it returns T, then
(SYMBOL-FUNCTION symbol) returns the (useless) special form handler.

7.1.2.
------

PSETQ is implemented as a special form and, as such, rather efficient.

7.2.
----

(SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION symbol) object) requires object to be either a
function, a SYMBOL-FUNCTION return value or a lambda expression. A lambda
expression is thereby immediately converted to a function.

SETF also accepts places yielding multiple values.

Additional places:

* FUNCALL:
  (SETF (FUNCALL #'symbol ...) object) and
  (SETF (FUNCALL 'symbol ...) object)
  are equivalent to (SETF (symbol ...) object).

* GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER:
  (SETF (GET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER ...) ...)
  performs a SET-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER.

* LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS:
  (SETF (LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS) digits) sets the default mantissa length of long
  floats to digits bits.

* VALUES:
  (SETF (VALUES place1 ... placek) form)
  is approximately equivalent to
     (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (dummy1 ... dummyk) form
       (SETF place1 dummy1 ... placek dummyk)
       (VALUES dummy1 ... dummyk)
     )
  Example:
    (SETF (VALUES A B) (VALUES B A)) interchanges the values of A and B.

* VALUES-LIST:
  (SETF (VALUES-LIST list) form)  is equivalent to
  (VALUES-LIST (SETF list (MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST form)))

&KEY markers in DEFSETF lambda lists are supported, but the corresponding
keywords must appear literally in the program text.

(GET-SETF-METHOD form &optional env) and
(GET-SETF-METHOD-MULTIPLE-VALUE form &optional env)
receives as optional argument the environment necessary for macro expansions.
In DEFINE-SETF-METHOD lambda lists, one can specify &ENVIRONMENT and a
variable, which will be bound to the environment. This environment should be
passed to all calls of GET-SETF-METHOD and GET-SETF-METHOD-MULTIPLE-VALUE.
If this is done, even local macros will be interpreted as places correctly.

7.3.
----

CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT is 65536 on 16-bit processors, 4294967296 on 32-bit
processors.

7.4.
----

PROG1 and PROG2 are implemented as special forms and, as such, rather
efficient.

7.5.
----

If using the optional package MACROS3:
  The macros LETF and LETF* are like LET and LET*, resp., except that they
  can bind places, even places with multiple values.
  Example:
  (LETF (((VALUES A B) form)) ...)
    is equivalent to
    (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (A B) form ...)
  (LETF (((FIRST L) 7)) ...)
    is approximately equivalent to
    (LET* ((#:G1 L) (#:G2 (FIRST #:G1)))
      (UNWIND-PROTECT (PROGN (SETF (FIRST #:G1) 7) ...)
                      (SETF (FIRST #:G1) #:G2)
    ) )

7.6.
----

WHEN, UNLESS, COND are implemented as special forms and, as such, rather
efficient.

7.8.4.
------

The function MAPCAP is like MAPCAN, except that it concatenates the
resulting lists with APPEND instead of NCONC:
  (MAPCAP fun x1 ... xn) == (apply #'append (mapcar fun x1 ... xn))
(Actually a bit more efficient that this would be.)

The function MAPLAP is like MAPCON, except that it concatenates the
resulting lists with APPEND instead of NCONC:
  (MAPLAP fun x1 ... xn) = (apply #'append (maplist fun x1 ... xn))
(Actually a bit more efficient that this would be.)

7.9.1.
------

MULTIPLE-VALUES-LIMIT = 128

MULTIPLE-VALUE-LIST, MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ are
implemented as special forms and, as such, rather efficient.

If using the optional package MACROS3:
  The macro NTH-VALUE:
  (NTH-VALUE n form) returns the (n+1)st value (n>=0) of form.


                        CHAPTER 8: Macros
                        -----------------

No notes.


                     CHAPTER 9: Declarations
                     -----------------------

9.2.
----

The declarations (TYPE type var ...), (FTYPE type fun ...),
(FUNCTION name arglist result-type), (OPTIMIZE (quality value) ...)
are ignored by the interpreter and the compiler.

Additional declarations:

* The declaration (COMPILE) has the effect that the current form is compiled
  prior to execution.
  Examples:
  (LOCALLY (DECLARE (COMPILE)) form)
  executes a compiled version of form.
  (let ((x 0))
    (flet ((inc () (declare (compile)) (incf x))
           (dec () (decf x)))
      (values #'inc #'dec)
  ) )
  returns two functions. The first is compiled and increments x, the second
  is interpreted (slower) and decrements the same x.

9.3.
----

The type assertion (THE value-type form) enforces a type check in
interpreted code. No type check is done in compiled code.

If using the optional package MACROS3:
(ETHE value-type form) enforces a type check in both interpreted and
compiled code.


                         CHAPTER 10: Symbols
                         -------------------

No notes.


                         CHAPTER 11: Packages
                         --------------------

11.6.
-----

The package SYSTEM has the nicknames "SYS" and, additionally, "COMPILER".

11.8.
-----

The function REQUIRE receives as optional argument either a pathname or a
list of pathnames: files to be loaded if the required module is not already
in memory.


                           CHAPTER 12: Numbers
                           -------------------

The single and double float formats are those of the IEEE standard (1981),
except that CLISP does not support features like +0, -0, +inf, -inf, gradual
underflow, NaN, etc. (Common Lisp does not make use of these features.)

The default number of mantissa bits in long floats is given by the place
(LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS).
Example: (SETF (LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS) 3322) sets the default precision of long
floats to 1000 decimal digits.

12.1.
-----

Complex numbers can have a real part and an imaginary part of different
types. If the imaginary part is EQL to 0, the number is automatically
converted to a real number. (Cf. CLtL1 p. 195)
This has the advantage that  (let ((x (sqrt -9.0))) (* x x))
- instead of evaluting to #C(-9.0 0.0), with x = #C(0.0 3.0) -
evaluates to #C(-9.0 0) = -9.0, with x = #C(0 3.0).

Coercions on operations involving different types:
The result of an arithmetic operation whose arguments are of different float
types is rounded to the float format of the shortest (least precise) of the
arguments.
    rational -> long float -> double float -> single float -> short float
(in contrast to CLtL1 p. 195!)
Rationale:
  See it mathematically. Add intervals:
  {1.0 +/- 1e-8} + {1.0 +/- 1e-16} = {2.0 +/- 1e-8}
  So, if we add 1.0s0 and 1.0d0, we should get 2.0s0.
Shortly:
  Do not suggest accuracy of a result by giving it a precision that is
  greater than its accuracy.
Example:
  (- (+ 1.7 pi) pi)  should not return  1.700000726342836417234L0,
  it should return 1.7f0 (or 1.700001f0 if there were rounding errors).
Experience:
  If in a computation using thousands of short floats, a long float (like pi)
  happens to be used, the long precision should not propagate throughout all
  the intermediate values. Otherwise, the long result would look precise,
  but its accuracy is only that of a short float; furthermore much
  computation time would be lost by calculating with long floats when only
  short floats would be needed.

When rational numbers are to be converted to floats (due to FLOAT, COERCE,
SQRT or a transcendental function), the result type is given by the variable
*DEFAULT-FLOAT-FORMAT*.

12.4.
-----

(LCM), called without arguments, returns 1, which is the neutral element of
composition with LCM.

(! n) returns the factorial of n, n a nonnegative integer.

(EXQUO x y) returns the quotient x/y of two integers x,y, and checks that it
is an integer. (This is more efficient than /.)

12.5.1.
-------

(EXPT base exponent) is not very precise if exponent has large absolute
value.

(LOG number base) signals an error if base = 1.

12.5.2.
-------

The value of PI is a long float with the precision given by
(LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS). When this precision is changed, the value of PI is
automatically recomputed. Therefore PI is a variable, not a constant.

12.6.
-----

FLOAT-RADIX always returns 2.

(FLOAT-DIGITS number digits) coerces `number' (a real number) to a floating
point number with at least `digits' mantissa digits. The following holds:
   (>= (FLOAT-DIGITS (FLOAT-DIGITS number digits)) digits)

12.7.
-----

BOOLE-CLR   =  0
BOOLE-SET   = 15
BOOLE-1     = 10
BOOLE-2     = 12
BOOLE-C1    =  5
BOOLE-C2    =  3
BOOLE-AND   =  8
BOOLE-IOR   = 14
BOOLE-XOR   =  6
BOOLE-EQV   =  9
BOOLE-NAND  =  7
BOOLE-NOR   =  1
BOOLE-ANDC1 =  4
BOOLE-ANDC2 =  2
BOOLE-ORC1  = 13
BOOLE-ORC2  = 11

12.10.
------

MOST-POSITIVE-FIXNUM = 2^24-1 = 16777215
MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM = -2^24 = -16777216

Together with PI, the other long float constants MOST-POSITIVE-LONG-FLOAT,
LEAST-POSITIVE-LONG-FLOAT, LEAST-NEGATIVE-LONG-FLOAT,
MOST-NEGATIVE-LONG-FLOAT, LONG-FLOAT-EPSILON, LONG-FLOAT-NEGATIVE-EPSILON
are recomputed whenever (LONG-FLOAT-DIGITS) is changed. They are variables,
not constants.


                         CHAPTER 13: Characters
                         ----------------------

See first above: 2.2.

13.1.
-----

CHAR-CODE-LIMIT = 256
CHAR-FONT-LIMIT = 16
CHAR-BITS-LIMIT = 16

13.2.
-----

String-chars are those characters with font = 0 and bits = 0.

The graphic characters have been described above.

The standard characters are #\Newline and those graphic characters with a
code between 32 and 126 (inclusive).

The alphabetic characters are these string-chars:
             ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
             abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
and the international alphabetic characters from the character set:
             «¸È‚‰‡ÂÁÍÎËÔÓÏƒ≈…Ê∆ÙˆÚ˚˘ˇ÷‹ﬂ·ÌÛ˙Ò—™∫A etc.

The functions CHAR-EQUAL, CHAR-NOT-EQUAL, CHAR-LESSP, CHAR-GREATERP,
CHAR-NOT-GREATERP, CHAR-NOT-LESSP ignore bits and font attributes of their
arguments.

13.4.
-----

The string chars that are not graphic chars and the space character have
names:
  (code-char #x00) = #\Null
  (code-char #x07) = #\Bell
  (code-char #x08) = #\Backspace = #\Rubout
  (code-char #x09) = #\Tab
  (code-char #x0A) = #\Newline = #\Linefeed
  (code-char #x0B) = #\Code11
  (code-char #x0C) = #\Page
  (code-char #x0D) = #\Return
  (code-char #x1A) = #\Code26
  (code-char #x1B) = #\Escape
  (code-char #x20) = #\Space

13.5.

CHAR-CONTROL-BIT = 1
CHAR-META-BIT    = 2
CHAR-SUPER-BIT   = 4
CHAR-HYPER-BIT   = 8


                         CHAPTER 14: Sequences
                         ---------------------

14.1.
-----

The result of NREVERSE is always EQ to the argument. NREVERSE on a vector
swaps pairs of elements. NREVERSE on a list swaps the first and the last
element and reverses the list chaining between them.

14.2.
-----

For iteration through a sequence, a macro DOSEQ, analogous to DOLIST, may be
used instead of MAP :
  (doseq (var seqform [resultform]) {declaration}* {tag|statement}* )

14.3.
-----

REMOVE, REMOVE-IF, REMOVE-IF-NOT, REMOVE-DUPLICATES return their argument
unchanged, if no element has to be removed.

DELETE, DELETE-IF, DELETE-IF-NOT, DELETE-DUPLICATES destructively modify
their argument: If the argument is a list, the CDR parts are modified. If
the argument is a vector with fill pointer, the fill pointer is lowered and
the remaining elements are compacted below the new fill pointer.

14.5.
-----

SORT and STABLE-SORT have two additional keywords :START and :END :
  (SORT sequence predicate &key :key :start :end)
  (STABLE-SORT sequence predicate &key :key :start :end)

SORT and STABLE-SORT are identical. They implement the mergesort algorithm.


                         CHAPTER 15: Lists
                         -----------------

15.4.
-----

SUBLIS and NSUBLIS apply the :KEY argument to the nodes of the cons tree and
not to the keys of the alist.


                      CHAPTER 16: Hash Tables
                      -----------------------

16.1.
-----

MAKE-HASH-TABLE has an additional keyword :INITIAL-CONTENTS :
  (MAKE-HASH-TABLE &key :test :initial-contents :size :rehash-size
                        :rehash-threshold)
The :INITIAL-CONTENTS argument is an alist that is used to initialize the
new hash table.
The :REHASH-THRESHOLD argument is ignored.

For iteration through a hash table, a macro DOHASH, analogous to DOLIST, can
be used instead of MAPHASH :
  (dohash (key-var value-var hash-table-form [resultform])
    {declaration}* {tag|statement}*
  )


                     CHAPTER 17: Arrays
                     ------------------

17.1.
-----

ARRAY-RANK-LIMIT is 65536 on 16-bit processors, 4294967296 on 32-bit
processors.

ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT  = 2^24 = 16777216
ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT = 2^24 = 16777216

17.6.
-----

An array to which another array is displaced should not be shrunk (using
ADJUST-ARRAY) in such a way that the other array points into void space.
This is not checked at the time ADJUST-ARRAY is called!


                       CHAPTER 18: Strings
                       -------------------

18.2.
-----

String comparison is based on the function CHAR<=. Therefore diphtongs do
not obey the usual national rules. Example: "o" < "oe" < "z" < "ˆ".


                        CHAPTER 19: Structures
                        ----------------------

19.5.
-----

The :PRINT-FUNCTION option should contain a lambda expression
  (lambda (structure stream depth) (declare (ignore depth)) ...)
This lambda expression names a function whose task is to output the external
representation of structure onto the stream. This may be done by outputting
text onto the stream using WRITE-CHAR, WRITE-STRING, WRITE, PRIN1, PRINC,
PRINT, PPRINT, FORMAT and the like. The following rules must be obeyed:
* The value of *PRINT-ESCAPE* must be respected.
* The value of *PRINT-PRETTY* should not and cannot be respected, since the
  pretty-print mechanism is not accessible from outside.
* The value of *PRINT-CIRCLE* need not to be respected. This is managed by
  the system. (But the print-circle mechanism handles only those objects that
  are (direct or indirect) components of structure.)
* The value of *PRINT-LEVEL* is respected by
  WRITE, PRIN1, PRINC, PRINT, PPRINT, FORMAT ~A, FORMAT ~S, FORMAT ~W and
  FORMAT ~D,~B,~O,~X,~R,~F,~E,~G,~$ with not-numerical arguments.
  Therefore the print-level mechanism works automatically if only these
  functions are used for outputting objects and if they are not called on
  objects with nesting level > 1. (The print-level mechanism does not
  recognize how many parentheses you have output. It only counts how many
  times it was called recursively.)
* The value of *PRINT-LENGTH* must be respected, especially if you are
  outputting an arbitrary number of components.
* You need not bother about the values of *PRINT-BASE*, *PRINT-RADIX*,
  *PRINT-CASE*, *PRINT-GENSYM*, *PRINT-ARRAY*, *PRINT-CLOSURE*.


                       CHAPTER 20: The Evaluator
                       -------------------------

As in Scheme, the Macro (THE-ENVIRONMENT) returns the current lexical
environment. This works only in interpreted code and is not compilable!

(EVAL-ENV form [env]) evaluates a form in a given lexical environment, just
if the form had been part of the program text that environment came from.


                         CHAPTER 21: Streams
                         -------------------

21.1.
-----

*TERMINAL-IO* is not the only stream that communicates directly with the
user: During execution of the body of a (WITH-KEYBOARD . body) form,
*KEYBOARD-INPUT* is the stream that reads the keystrokes from the keyboard.
It returns every keystroke in detail, as character with the following bits:
  HYPER        if a non-standard key. These are:
                 function keys, cursor keypads, numeric keypad.
  CHAR-CODE    the Ascii code for standard keys,
               for non-standard keys:
                 F1 -> #\F1, ..., F10 -> #\F10, F11 -> #\F11, F12 -> #\F12,
                 Insert -> #\Insert, Delete -> #\Delete,
                 Home -> #\Home, End -> #\End, PgUp -> #\PgUp, PgDn -> #\PgDn,
                 Arrow keys -> #\Up, #\Down, #\Left, #\Right.
  SUPER        if pressed together with Shift key(s) and if the keystroke
               would have been an other without Shift.
  CONTROL      if pressed together with the Control key.
  META         if pressed together with the Alternate key.
This keyboard input is not echoed on the screen.
During execution of a (WITH-KEYBOARD . body) form, no input from *TERMINAL-IO*
or any synonymous stream should be requested.

21.2.
-----

The macro WITH-OUTPUT-TO-PRINTER
       (with-output-to-printer (var) {declaration}* {form}*)
binds the variable var to an output stream that sends its output to the
printer.

21.3.
-----

CLOSE ignores its :ABORT argument.


                     CHAPTER 22: Input/Output
                     ------------------------

22.1.2.
-------

A "reserved token", i.e. a token that has potential number syntax but cannot
be interpreted as a number, is interpreted as symbol when being read. (CLtL1
p. 341)

When a token with package markers is read, then (CLtL1 p. 343/344) no
checking is done whether the package part and the symbol-name part do not
have number syntax. (What's the purpose of this check?) So we consider
tokens like USER:: or :1 or LISP::4711 or 21:3 as symbols.

22.1.3.
-------

The backquote read macro also works when nested. Example:
 (eval ``(,#'(lambda () ',a) ,#'(lambda () ',b)))
 = (eval `(list #'(lambda () ',a) #'(lambda () ',b)))
 = (eval (list 'list (list 'function (list 'lambda nil (list 'quote a)))
                     (list 'function (list 'lambda nil (list 'quote b)))
   )     )

22.1.4.
-------

#\ allows inputting characters of arbitrary code: #\Code231 yields the
character (code-char 231.).

Additional read dispatch macros:
* #Y is used to read compiled functions.
* #" is used to read pathnames:
     #"test.lsp" is the value of (pathname "test.lsp")
     As in all strings, backslashes must be written twice here:
     #"A:\\programs\\test.lsp"

22.1.5.
-------

Is it impossible to get the read macro function of a dispatch macro
character like #\# using GET-MACRO-CHARACTER.

22.1.6.
-------

In absence of SYS::WRITE-FLOAT, floating point numbers are output in radix 2.

Pathnames are written according to the syntax #"namestring" if
*PRINT-ESCAPE* /= NIL. If *PRINT-ESCAPE* = NIL, only the namestring is
printed.

*PRINT-CASE* controls the output not only of symbols, but also of characters
and some #<...> objects.

*PRINT-PRETTY* is initially = NIL.

*PRINT-ARRAY* is initially = T.

An additional variable *PRINT-CLOSURES* controls whether compiled and
interpreted functions (closures) are output in detailed form. If
*PRINT-CLOSURE* /= NIL, compiled closures are output in #Y syntax the reader
understands. *PRINT-CLOSURE* is initially = NIL.

22.3.1.
-------

The functions WRITE and WRITE-TO-STRING have an additional keyword :CLOSURE
that can be used to bind *PRINT-CLOSURE*.

22.3.3.
-------

The FORMAT option ~W is analogous to ~A and ~S, but avoids binding of
*PRINT-ESCAPE*. (FORMAT stream "~W" object) is equivalent to
(WRITE object :stream stream).

FORMAT ~R and FORMAT ~:R can output only integers in the range |n| < 10^66.
The output is in English, according to the American conventions, and these
conventions are identical to the British conventions only in the range
|n| < 10^9.

FORMAT ~:@C does not output the character itself, only the instruction how
to type the character.

FORMAT ~T can determine the current column of any stream.


                    CHAPTER 23: File System Interface
                    ---------------------------------

23.1.1.
-------

Pathname components:
HOST          always NIL
DEVICE        NIL or :WILD or "A"|...|"Z"
DIRECTORY     (startpoint . subdirs) where
               startpoint = :RELATIVE | :ABSOLUTE
               subdirs = () | (subdir . subdirs)
               subdir = :CURRENT (means ".") or
               subdir = :PARENT (means "..") or
               subdir = :WILD (means "...", all subdirectories) or
               subdir = (name . type)
                name = :WILD or a simple string with 8 characters maximum
                type = :WILD or a simple string with 3 characters maximum
NAME          NIL or :WILD or a simple string with 8 characters maximum
TYPE          NIL or :WILD or a simple string with 3 characters maximum
VERSION       always NIL (may also be specified as :WILD or :NEWEST)

When a pathname is to be fully specified (no wildcards), that means that
no :WILD is allowed, and NAME = NIL may not be allowed either.

External notation:        A:\sub1.typ\sub2.typ\name.typ
using defaults:             \sub1.typ\sub2.typ\name.typ
or                                             name.typ
or                        *:\sub1.typ\*.*\name.*
or similar.
Instead of '\' one may use '/', as usual for DOS calls.

23.1.2.
-------

External notation of pathnames (cf. PARSE-NAMESTRING and NAMESTRING),
of course without spaces, [,],{,}:
 [ [drivespec]         a letter '*'|'A'|...|'Z'|'a'|...|'z'
   :
 ]
 { name [. type] \ }   each one a subdirectory, '\' may be replaced by '/'
 [ name [. type] ]     filename with type (extension)

Name and type may be character sequences of any length (consisting of
alphanumeric characters and '-', '_'). They are shortened to 8 resp. 3
characters and converted to upper case. A single '*' is allowed for :WILD.

The function USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME is not implemented.

23.3.
-----

FILE-AUTHOR always returns NIL.

FILE-POSITION works on any file stream. When a Newline is output to resp.
input from a file stream, its file position is increased by 2 since Newline
is encoded as CR/LF in the file.

23.4.
-----

LOAD has two additional keywords :ECHO and :COMPILING.
(LOAD filename &key :verbose :print :echo :if-does-not-exist :compiling)
:VERBOSE T   causes LOAD to emit a short message that a file is being loaded.
             The default is *LOAD-VERBOSE*, which is initially = T.
:PRINT T     causes LOAD to print the value of each form.
             The default is *LOAD-PRINT*, which is initially = NIL.
:ECHO T      causes the input from the file to be echoed to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*
             (normally to the screen). Should there be an error in the file,
             you can see at one glance where it is.
             The default is *LOAD-ECHO*, which is initially = NIL.
:COMPILING T causes each form read to be compiled on the fly. The compiled
             code is executed at once and - in contrast to COMPILE-FILE -
             not written to a file.

The variable *LOAD-PATHS* contains a list of directories where program files
are searched - additionally to the specified or current directory - by LOAD,
REQUIRE, COMPILE-FILE.

23.5.
-----

(DIRECTORY [pathname [:full]]) can run in two modes:
* If pathname contains no name or type component, a list of all matching
  directories is produced.
* Otherwise a list of all matching files is returned. If the :FULL argument
  is /= NIL, this contains additional information: for each matching file
  you get a list of at least four elements
  (file-pathname file-truename file-write-date-as-decoded-time file-length).

(DIR [pathname]) is like DIRECTORY, but displays the pathnames instead of
returning them. (DIR) shows the contents of the current directory.

(CD [pathname]) manages the current device and the current directory.
(CD pathname) sets it, (CD) returns it.

(MAKE-DIR directory-pathname) creates a new subdirectory.

(DELETE-DIR directory-pathname) removes an (empty) subdirectory.

(EXECUTE programfile arg1 arg2 ...)  executes an external program. Its name
is programfile. It is given the strings arg1, arg2, ... as arguments.

(SHELL [command])  calls the operating system's shell.
(SHELL) calls the shell for interactive use. (SHELL command) calls the shell
only for execution of the one given command.


                        CHAPTER 24: Errors
                        ------------------

24.1.
-----

When an error occurred, you are in a break loop. You can evaluate forms as
usual. The HELP command (or help key if there is one) lists the available
debugging commands.


                  CHAPTER 25: Miscellaneous Features
                  ----------------------------------

25.1.
-----

The compiler can be called not only by the functions COMPILE, COMPILE-FILE
and DISASSEMBLE, also by the declaration (COMPILE).

(COMPILE-FILE input-file [:output-file] [:listing] [:verbose] [:warnings])
compiles a file to bytecode.
    input-file                should be a pathname/string/symbol.
The :output-file argument     should be NIL or T or a pathname/string/symbol
                              or an output-stream. The default is T.
The :listing argument         should be NIL or T or a pathname/string/symbol
                              or an output-stream. The default is NIL.
The :warnings argument        specifies whether warnings should also appear
                              on the screen.
The :verbose argument         specifies whether error messages should also
                              appear on the screen.

25.2.
-----

No on-line documentation is available for the system functions (yet).

25.3.
-----

(TRACE fun ...) makes the functions fun, ... traced. Syntax of fun:
Either a symbol:
       symbol
or a list of a symbol and some keywords and arguments (which must come in
pairs!):
       (symbol
         [:suppress-if form]   ; no trace output as long as form is true
         [:step-if form]       ; invokes the stepper as soon as form is true
         [:pre form]           ; evaluates form before calling the function
         [:post form]          ; evaluates form after return from the function
         [:pre-break-if form]  ; goes into the break loop before calling the
                               ; function if form is true
         [:post-break-if form] ; goes into the break loop after return from
                               ; the function if form is true
         [:pre-print form]     ; prints the values of form before calling the
                               ; function
         [:post-print form]    ; prints the values of form after return from
                               ; the function
         [:print form]         ; prints the values of form both before
                               ; calling and after return from the function
       )
In all these forms you can access
  the function itself               as *TRACE-FUNCTION*,
  the arguments to the function     as *TRACE-ARGS*,
  the function/macro call as form   as *TRACE-FORM*,
and after return from the function
  the list of return values from the function call  as *TRACE-VALUES*,
and you can leave the function call with specified values by using RETURN.

TRACE and UNTRACE are also applicable to macros, but not to locally defined
functions and macros.

The function INSPECT is not implemented.

The function ED calls the external editor specified by the variable *EDITOR*
(see config.lsp).
If using the optional package EDITOR:
  ED behaves like this only if the variable *USE-ED* is NIL.
  Otherwise ED uses an Emacs-like screen editor with multiple windows.

25.4.1.
-------

The variable *DEFAULT-TIME-ZONE* contains the default time zone used by
ENCODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME and DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME. It is initially set to -1
(which means 1 hour east of Greenwich, i.e. Mid European Time).

The timezone in a decoded time must not necessarily be an integer, but (as
float or rational number) it should be a multiple of 1/4.

INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND = 100.

25.4.2.
-------

The functions MACHINE-TYPE, MACHINE-VERSION, MACHINE-INSTANCE and
SHORT-SITE-NAME, LONG-SITE-NAME should be defined by every user in his
site-specific CONFIG.LSP file.

The variable *FEATURES* initially contains the symbols
   CLISP              ; this implementation
   INTERPRETER
   COMPILER
   ATARI              ; if hardware = Atari ST/TT and operating system = TOS
   AMIGA              ; if hardware = Amiga       and operating system = OS
   DOS                ; if hardware = PC (clone)  and operating system = DOS
   OS/2               ; if hardware = PC (clone)  and operating system = OS/2
   PC386              ; if hardware = PC (clone) with a 386/486
   UNIX               ; if                            operating system = Unix
                      ;                               (yes, in this case the
                      ;                               hardware is irrelevant!)
   language           ; same as the value of *LANGUAGE*

The constant *LANGUAGE* is a string containing the language in which the
system communicates with the user. A symbol of the same name is contained in
*FEATURES*. Possible values are (yet): ENGLISH, DEUTSCH, FRANCAIS.
