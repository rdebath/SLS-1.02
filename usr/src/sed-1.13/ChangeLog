Wed Nov 18 02:10:58 1992  Tom Lord  (lord@unix2.andrew.cmu.edu)

	* sed.c (execute_program): Made s///p print even if -n was
	specified.

	* sed.c (compile_string): Changed the type of this function to
	fix a compile warning.

Wed Nov  4 17:15:34 1992  Tom Lord  (lord@unix7.andrew.cmu.edu)

	* sed.c (main): Initialize the hold area to contain "\n"
	instead of "".  In execute_program, all lines are expected
	to be newline terminated.  Also, if H is the first command
	in the script, the result is a pattern buffer that begins
	with a blank line.  Thanks to pinard@iro.umontreal.ca
	(Francois Pinard) for pointing out this and many other bugs.

	* sed.c (execute_program): Fixed a case of `D' command.
	  Thanks Chris Weber <weber@bucknell.edu>

	* sed.c: added new tests of no_default_output to make -n work.
	  Thanks Andrew Herbert <andrew@werple.apana.org.au>

	* sed.c, configure.in,Makefile.in: autoconfed bcopy and const.
	  Thanks "J.T. Conklin" <jtc@gain.com>

	* sed.c: made prog_cur, prog_start, and prog_end unsigned so
	that users could write  `sed -e s/ÿ/foo/g'.

Tue Oct 13 00:04:05 1992  Tom Lord  (lord@unix3.andrew.cmu.edu)

	* sed.c (execute_program): fixed the cycling behavior of 'D'

	* sed.c: integrated patch that closes files

	* sed.c: changed regexp syntax

Fri May 22 15:11:12 1992  Tom Lord  (lord at moriarty.bh.andrew.cmu.edu)

	* regex.c:  this is not my change, but a pointer to the fact
	that karl@gnu fixed some regexp bugs that were plaguing sed.

Thu Apr 30 13:02:21 1992  Tom Lord  (lord at unix3.andrew.cmu.edu)

	* sed.c (compile_program, execute_program)
	subprograms are now compiled with an explicit continuation ;)
	return_v and return_i in struct vector.  execute_program
	no longer recurses to execute subprograms (case '{') and now
	understands a return instruction (case '{').

Tue Apr 28 17:13:04 1992  Tom Lord  (lord at unix7.andrew.cmu.edu)

	* sed.c (compile_address) added \?regexp? syntax for addresses.

	* sed.c (main) added {} intervals to the obscure regexp
	  syntax.

	* sed.c (compile_program)  after calling compile_address,
	  normalize numeric addresses (make a2.addr_number > a1.addr_number).
	  This is necessary because line numbers must match exactly, 
	  but sed does not try to match a2 until after a1 has matched,
	  yet a1,a2 where a2 <= a1 is defined to be equivelent to
	  a1,a1+1

Sat Feb 29 10:55:54 1992  David J. MacKenzie  (djm@nutrimat)

	* sed.c (usage): Document long options as starting with `--'.

Mon Dec  9 23:56:40 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c: Include sys/types.h, for new regex.h.

Tue Nov  5 02:16:01 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* utils.c: Change NO_VFPRINTF to VPRINTF_MISSING, for
	compatibility with autoconf.

Mon Sep  2 22:02:40 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* sed.c (compile_regex): Treat \ as a normal character when in
	a char class.

Thu Aug  8 00:15:33 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at bleen)

	* Version 1.08.

	* sed.c (compile_filename): If reading a file fails, read
	/dev/null instead.  It's what Unix and POSIX do, effectively.

	* sed.c (compile_regex): The 'slash' character doesn't
	terminate the regex if it's in a character class.

	* sed.c (main): If given no args, or bad option, print usage
	message.
	(usage): New function.

	* sed.c (execute_program): Amount written for 'P' command was
	wrong.  From stephend@ksr.com (Stephen Davis).

Wed Aug  7 16:51:14 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* sed.c (append_pattern_space): Check for buffer full before
	instead of after writing to buffer.  Don't need to test for
	EOF initially anymore, due to the next change.
	(execute_program): For 'n' and 'N' commands, if eof is reached
	in input, quit the script like Unix sed does.
	Fix memory allocation problems for 'a' and 'r' commands.
	(compile_program): Fix off by one error in processing comments.
	All of the above are from Tapani Tarvainen, tarvaine@tukki.jyu.fi.

	* sed.c (setup_jump): Use isblank instead of testing for ' '
	or '\t', for POSIX locales.

	* utils.c (ck_strdup): Renamed from strdup.
	* sed.c: Change callers.

	* sed.c, utils.c: Clean up declarations and includes to get
	rid of compiler warnings.

	* sed.c (main): Add long-named options.  Don't complain if -n
	is given twice.

Fri Aug  2 12:33:16 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at apple-gunkies)

	* configure: Support +srcdir arg.  Create config.status and
	remove it and Makefile if interrupted while creating them.
	* Makefile.in: Change DESTDIR to prefix.

Mon Jul 15 13:07:39 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (main): Add -V option to print version number.
	(USAGE): Mention -V.

Mon Jul  8 01:42:22 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at geech.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c: Define bcopy in terms of memcpy if STDC_HEADERS as
	well as if USG.
	(compile_filename): Don't glob filename (for 'r' and 'w'
	commands).  Unix sed doesn't do it and it's not very useful,
	since it can only match 0 or 1 files.
	(execute_program): Change '\a' to 007 since some compilers
	don't recognize \a.
	* utils.c: New file; code moved from sed.c.
	* Replace Makefile with Makefile.in and configure.
	Update README.

Tue Mar 26 13:00:48 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (match_address)  Added a trivial cast for portability.

Mon Feb 25 13:23:29 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c  Changed 's' command to work with latest version of regex()
	routines, which mysteriously changed somewhere in there. . .
	A one-line patch from David Eckelkamp (eckelkamp@mcc.com).

	Initialize the fastmap in the hopes that it'll make sed faster.

Thu Feb 21 13:42:27 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mti.edu)

	* sed.c Change panic to compile with other __STDC__ compilers.

Wed Jan 30 10:46:38 EST 1991	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c  Changed version number.  Made new release.

Tue Nov 27 15:34:51 EST 1990	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (setup_jump)  Don't blow chunks if there isn't a label
	after a b or t command.

		(main) Don't panic if it a branch command doesn't have
	a label to branch to.

		(main)  Collect all the -e arguments together and parse them
	all at once.  This way, -e { -e mumble -e } will work.

	All these small patches from David Schmidt (davids@isc-br.isc-br.com)

Tue Sep 11 12:51:37 EDT 1990	Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c Changed some function forward declarations to use VOID *
	instead of char *

Mon Jul 16 11:12:54 EDT 1990 Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (ck_malloc)  Use malloc(1) instead of malloc(0) if given
	a request for zero bytes.

Tue Jun  5 02:05:37 1990  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at albert.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c: Remove excess newlines from calls to panic.
	Reformat some comments to fit in 79 columns.
	Base whether to use void * on __STDC__, not __GNU__.
	(main): Add missing arg when printing usage message.
	Print usage if given invalid arg.
	(panic) [__STDC__]: Add missing ", ...".
	(compile_filename): Print correct error message if glob_filename
	returns NULL.

Thu Apr  5 21:41:12 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (execute_program, case 'r'): When need to realloc append.text,
	multiply append.alloc by 2 instead of adding
	cur_cmd->x.cmd_txt.text_len.

Tue Mar  6 15:55:35 EST 1990 Jay Fenlason (hack@ai.mit.edu)

	* sed.c (compile_regex)  Allocate 10 bytes extra space needed by
	re_compile_pattern.

Sun Feb 25 16:32:10 1990  Jim Kingdon  (kingdon at pogo.ai.mit.edu)

	Print backslash as \\ not \.
	Print \xx instead of /xx.

Thu Feb  1 14:02:28 EST 1990		hack@wookumz

	* sed.c (memchr)  Use () inside inner loop so it will work correctly.
	A two character patch from Robert A Bruce (rab@allspice.berkeley.edu)

Wed Sep 27 18:47:39 EDT 1989		hack@ai.mit.edu

	* sed.c (compile_regex)  New function.  When compiling regex,
	turn ^ into \` and $ into \' so that they won't match on embedded
	newlines.  UN*X	pattern matching is a crock.
	(compile_program, compile_address) call compile_regex.

Mon Sep 18 10:15:32 EDT 1989		hack@ai.mit.edu

	* sed.c (compile_program):  define translate as unsigned char * so
	that y command will work on non-ascii characters.

	Changed version number to 1.06.

Thu Sep 14 15:57:08 EDT 1989		hack@ai.mit.edu

	* sed.c  (compile_program)  Let programs use ; to terminate } as
	well as newline.

	(read_file) Print an error msg to stderr if it can't open an
 	input file.

Thu Mar 23 18:04:46 1989  Randall Smith  (randy at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile, sed.c: Added new copyright notice.

	* Makefile: Make distributions which follow the symlinks.
