XMenu - provide a popup menu from a shell script etc.

This little toolkit program produces a popup menu on the screen taking
the command line arguments as menu entries.  If an argument contains
a non-escaped '=' (equals sign) the string to the left is the name
displayed in the menu and the string to the right is the text output
when this menu button is pressed.

A special argument "line" can be used to draw a dividing line between
successive menu entries.

A menu title can be given as an argument after a "-heading" flag.

The menu is only popped down when a menu button is pressed.
By default the menu is popped up below and to the right of the current
pointer position, use "-geometry" to position the menu at a particular
point (and in a particular size). 

Examples:

xmenu -heading "Choose Files by Suffix" Compressed="*.Z" \
		"C sources"="*.c" "Headers"="*.h" \
		line line "        Cancel"
 
xmenu Hello="Hello World" line " " " " line Goodbye="Goodbye World"
