[ \fB\-f\fP\fIrate\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDclock\fP displays a scalable digital clock.
The time is updated from the local host clock every minute as a background
process.  The current date is displayed across the top of the window
in the format

(or some subset of such if there's not enough room).
Options to control the clock's appearance,
size and placement are as follows:
.TP 16
\fB\-c\fP 
Display in 12-hour format (\*(lq\fIc\fPivilian\*(rq time) \(em the
default.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Display in 24-hour format (\*(lq\fIm\fPilitary\*(rq time).
.TP
\fB\-j\fP
\*(lq\fIJ\fPohn's flag.\*(rq  Puts a tail on the digit `9'.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
Do \fInot\fP display the current \fId\fPate across the top of the
clock view.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP
Display a \fIb\fPorder (horizontal line) between the date string and the
time display.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Do \fInot\fP display the \fIT\fPime in the clock view (leaving just the date).
.TP
\fB\-s\fP\fIslant\fP
Set the \fIslant\fP of the digits.  A \fIslant\fP of 100 (the maximum)
corresponds to a slant of one digit width.  A \fIslant\fP of 0 (the
minimum) is vertical.  Default is \fB\-s30\fP.  A special form is
\fB\-s\fP, which is equivalent to \fB\-s0\fP.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP\fIthickness\fP
Set the \fIthickness\fP of the digit segments.  Allowable values are
between 5 and 25.  A \fIthickness\fP of 25 results in segments which
are one quarter (25%) of the digit width. Default is \fB\-t15\fP.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP\fIrate\fP
Set the \fIrate\fP at which the segments fade when the time changes.
A value of 0 is fastest and 4 is slowest.  Default is \fB\-f4\fP.  A
special form is \fB\-f\fP, which is equivalent to \fB\-f0\fP.
.PP
To exit \fIdclock\fP, type a `q' in the window.
