X11 Based Tetris / Version 2.5

INSTALLATION

1. Make sure you have X11 release 5, and make sure that "xmkmf" is in your
   path somewhere (probably at /usr/bin/X11/xmkmf or /usr/X11R5/bin/xmkmf).

2. Edit the switches at the top of Imakefile as necessary.

3. I assume you want to use your installed libraries and include
   files.  So type

      xmkmf
      make depend

4. Install it.

      (become root or something)
      make install

5. Now, if you get bored with playing the game, you can look in the file
   TODO, for a list of useful things you could help add.

   If you do anything listed in the "TODO" file, please send your changes
   to xtetris@cs.ucla.edu.

6. If you fix ANYTHING, please send a "diff -c" file.  The address:

     xtetris@cs.ucla.edu

WHY IT CRASHES

   Lots of people install this thing in their local account, and when
   they bring it up, it crashes with "Widget has zero height" or
   something like that.  This is because the application defaults
   files have not been installed.

   What can you do?

   csh:
     setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=./%N%C.ad:./%N.ad

   bash/sh/ksh:
     XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=./%N%C.ad:./%N.ad
     export XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

   Then make sure that you run xtetris from its build directory.

WHODUNNIT

  This version of xtetris has accumulated the work of several individuals.

  Adam Marguilies <vespa@ssyx.ucsc.edu> wrote the first non-graphics version.

  Phill Everson <everson@cs.bris.ac.uk> and Martyn Shortley 
  <shortley@cs.bris.ac.uk> posted a later non-graphics version of tetris to
  comp.sources.games in March 1989. 

  Didier Tallot <tallot@bdblues.altair.fr> built an X11 graphics xtetris from
  the non-graphics tetris around 29 May, 1989.  It used the unsupported 
  Xw (HP) widget set.

Xtetris 2.0 and 2.1:

  Dan Greening <dgreen@cs.ucla.edu> rewrote much of the xtetris code to
    a. Eliminate use of the unsupported Xw widget set, and use Xaw.
    b. Speed up drawing, and legality calculations.
    c. Move format, color specifications, key bindings, button bindings,
       and other parameters into the "application defaults" file.
    d. Make appropriate buttons appear when usable and disappear when unusable.
    e. Use X11R4.
  
  Janet L. Carson added assignable colors for the objects, and supplied a
  black/white application defaults file.

Xtetris 2.2: 

  Bill Kucharski and Tony Cooper fixed a couple of bugs.  Chris Thewalt 
  merged the color and b/w files.

  Dan Greening sped up the drawing code even more.

Xtetris 2.3:

  Greg Rogers added the (scary!) speed option.  If you have a high speed 
  machine, like an IBM RS-6000, just try to run it with -speed 100.
  Dan Greening fixed minor bugs.

Xtetris 2.4:

  Evan Harris fixed a long-standing memory leak (caused by a bug in
  asciiTextWidgets).  Many thanks.

Xtetris 2.5:

  Dan Greening added color/bw switchability, an about window, a better
  scores window, slightly faster startup, changed it to work on X11R5.
  Jim Bash improved the portability of the code.  Jamie Zawinski
  figured out how to make Unmap automatically pause the game (an 
  elegantly simple solution).  Bud Osterberg thought of a better
  scoring algorithm, which was partially installed.

WHERE WILL IT RUN

  Version 2.5 has been tested on X11 release 5, on

    a color Sun IPC running SunOS 4.1.1.
    a b/w Dec 5000/120 running Ultrix 4.2

  It REQUIRES X11 release 5 libraries and include files.  It should run on any
  processor which has these installed.  Do not ask for a release 4 version.
