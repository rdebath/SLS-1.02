reshape:

Syntax:	reshape ( A , nrow, ncol )

Description:

	Reshape does what it's name implies, it reshapes the input
	matrix so that the return value has the number of rows and
	columns specified by the last two arguments. Reshape will not
	reshape the matrix if the product of the new row and column
	dimensions does not equal the product of the existing row and
	column dimensions.

Examples:

	m = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
	mrow = reshape(m, 1, 9); // converts m to a row matrix
	mcol = reshape(m, 9, 1); // converts m to a column matrix
