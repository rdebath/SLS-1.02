===== Oleo 1.2.2 =====

This is a bugfix release.  Nearly all bugs reported for 1.2.1 have
been fixed (a few could not be reproduced).  Many portability problems
have been fixed.

Release 1.2.2 has been built and (minimally) tested on these systems:

	RS/6000 running AIX
	Sun4 running SunOS 4.1.1
	Sun3 running SunOS 4.1.1_U1

A more significant amount of testing has been done on DECstation
5000's running Ultrix 4.2.

===== Oleo 1.2.1 =====

This is a bugfix release.  Various configuration problems and a few
trivial bugs in the 1.2 release have been repaired.

===== Oleo 1.2 =====

This is primarily a bigfix release.  In addition, there are some new features.

* New command line options

  --version or -v: print out a version number
  --quiet or -q: don't print the disclaimer
  --ignore-init-file or -f: don't read commands from .oleorc or ~/.oleorc

* New commands/Changes to commands

  write-variables:  writes to a file or pipe the values of all variables 
	that are bound to cells.  Variables bound to regions are not 
	written.

  read-variables: The inverse of write-variables.  Variables that are
	bound to a range cause an error.  Variables not bound to a
	cell are ignored.

  Format-cell and format-region can now be used to set cell fonts.

  set-region-forumla: This can be used to edit many cells at once.

  {upper,lower}-{left,right}: These commands go to extremes.  They are
  bound to M-{^Y ^U ^B and ^N}.

  {insert,delete}-{row,column}: new commands bound to ^O, ^K, M-^O, M-^K.

  {move,copy}-region: these commands now work (at least for many test cases).

  exchange-point-and-mark: ^X ^X

* File Format Changes

  SYLK mode appears to have changed at some time in the past.  Older
  (and correct, i presume)  versions write cell references in a0
  format.  The last alpha and early beta releases use rc format.  
  Now there are two file formats ``sylk'' and ``sylk-noa0''.
  If older sylk files don't work with one, they may with the other.
  Hopefully, between them, all oleo-generated sylk files can be read.
  Users are encouraged to read and write files in ``oleo'' format (the
  default).

  Oleo file format has changed in a (hopefully) upward compatable way.

  When reading sylk or oleo files, a format error now causes the read
  to be aborted.

  Oleo no longer generates a panic file on any signal (it dumps core
  like everyone else).

* X tweaks
 
  The window now has a title.

  Whatever key corresponds to Mod1Mask is treated as a meta key.

  The resources oleo.geometry, oleo.foreground and oleo.background
  have the expected effects.

* New formula functions

  In the `cells' package there is a new function vlookup_str that can
  be used to search a table, using a keyword string.  See USING.

This is a bugfix release.  Release 1.0 had a few trivial, but fatal
bugs, and didn't work at all unless you editted global.h first.  If
you had trouble with that release, please try this one.  

If formulas don't seem to work at all, or if you experience core dumps
when defining formulas, check to see that that the definition of
CELLREF in globals.h is correct for your system.  The current
definitions assume that characters are 8 bits, and the short integers
are 16 bits.

All reported bugs have been fixed.

The opening disclaimer is no longer printed if you have a .oleorc file.
