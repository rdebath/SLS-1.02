% desiredSize EvenPixels closestSize
%
% The procedure below is used for stippling.  Given the optimal size
% of a dot in a stipple pattern in the current user coordinate system,
% compute the closest size that is an exact multiple of the device's
% pixel size.  This allows stipple patterns to be displayed without
% aliasing effects.

% width height string filled StippleFill --
%
% Given a path and other graphics information already set up, this
% procedure will fill the current path in a stippled fashion.  "String"
% contains a proper image description of the stipple pattern and
% "width" and "height" give its dimensions.  If "filled" is true then
% it means that the area to be stippled is gotten by filling the
% current path (e.g. the interior of a polygon); if it's false, the
% area is gotten by stroking the current path (e.g. a wide line).
% Each stipple dot is assumed to be about one unit across in the
% current user coordinate system.

/StippleFill {
    % Turn the path into a clip region that we can then cover with
    % lots of images corresponding to the stipple pattern.  Warning:
    % some Postscript interpreters get errors during strokepath for
    % dashed lines.  If this happens, turn off dashes and try again.

% x y strings spacing xoffset yoffset justify stipple image DrawText --
% This procedure does all of the real work of drawing text.  The
% color and font must already have been set by the caller, and the
% following arguments must be on the stack:
%
% x, y -	Coordinates at which to draw text.
% strings -	An array of strings, one for each line of the text item,
%		in order from top to bottom.
% spacing -	Spacing between lines.
% xoffset -	Horizontal offset for text bbox relative to x and y: 0 for
%		nw/w/sw anchor, -0.5 for n/center/s, and -1.0 for ne/e/se.
% yoffset -	Vertical offset for text bbox relative to x and y: 0 for
%		nw/n/ne anchor, +0.5 for w/center/e, and +1.0 for sw/s/se.
% justify -	0 for left justification, 0.5 for center, 1 for right justify.
% stipple -	Boolean value indicating whether or not text is to be
%		drawn in stippled fashion.
% image -	Image for stippling, if stipple is True.
%
% Also, when this procedure is invoked, the color and font must already
% have been set for the text.
