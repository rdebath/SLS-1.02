3/19/91: DONE: move -C, -V, -c options to -W ala posix

3/19/91: DONE: -W posix option, throw out \x

3/19/91: DONE: clean up ifdef stuff, go to config.h

3/19/91: DONE: -W lint option

4/5/91: DONE: change from time and ctime to sysclock and strftime

4/21/91: DONE: make /dev/fd checking happen at run time

4/14/91: DONE: man page fix up

4/17/91: DONE: Table driven built-in subroutine argument count checking

6/1/92: DONE: Update regex.h flags for AWK and feed back to FSF

Feedback alloca.s changes to FSF

10/28/91: DONE: Brief manual clean up

4/18/91: DONE: Provide a list of systems
			a) where gawk has been ported
			b) where it has run the test suite

For 2.14
========

6/18/92: DONE: "next file" keyword sequence

10/28/91: DONE: Warn or fatal if identifier used as both variable and array

12/22/91: DONE:	Variables string or numeric or both

In 2.15 or later
================

more lint: check for use of builtin vars. only in new awk.

Extensible hashing and on-disk storage of awk arrays

"restart" keyword

Add |&

Split() with null string as third arg to split up strings

Analogously, setting FS="" would split the input record into individual
characters.

Allow RS to be a regexp.

RECLEN variable for fixed length records

Make 	awk '/foo/' files...	run at egrep speeds

Extensive manual cleanup:

	Use of texinfo 2.0 features

	Lots more examples

	Add an error messages section to the manual

	A section on where gawk is bounded
		regex
		i/o
		sun fp conversions

Do a reference card

? Have strftime() pay attention to the value of ENVIRON["TZ"]

A way to mix library files and command line strings for source code (-s?)

Allow OFMT to be other than a floating point format.

? SFIO based printf and other i/o

Allow redefining of builtin functions?

Incorporate newer dfa.c and regex.c

Make regex + dfa less dependant on gawk header file includes

General sub functions	edit(line, pat, sub) and gedit(line, pat, sub) that
  return the substituted strings and allow \1 etc. in the sub string.

Add lint checking everywhere

Make it faster and smaller.

Create a gawk-to-C translator? (or C++??)

Create a gawk compiler?

Do an optimization pass over parse tree?

Provide awk profiling and debugging.

Clean up code by isolating system-specific functions in separate files.

Move to autoconf-based configure system.
