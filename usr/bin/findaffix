# Revision 1.9  89/06/09  15:52:24  geoff
# Major rewrite.  It now can generate affixes that require the stripping
# of characters before they are appended.  Because of this, it now also
# runs for days (literally, at least on my machine), and uses tens or even
# hundreds of thousands of blocks of temporary disk space.  It's time to
# turn this into a C program, especially because it's not very clever about
# string characters.

# Change Header to Id;  nobody cares about my pathnames.

# Revision 1.6  88/11/25  19:50:32  geoff
# Added the -a, -f, and -l options.  (Actually, the -a and -f options select
# operation as it was before, and the defaults are the new code.)  Add code
# to suppress affixes that don't generate legal roots, and to generate an
# estimate of the number of bytes that would be saved in the hash file by
# a given affix.

# Revision 1.5  88/02/20  23:10:38  geoff
# Fix some bugs in the awk loops with respect to words longer than the
# maximum affix length.

# Initial revision
# 
#
#	Find possible affixes for use with ispell
#
#	Usage:
#
#	findaffix [-p | -s] [-f] [-c] [-m min] [-M max] [-e elim] [-l low] \
#	  [-t tabchar] [files]
#
#	Each common prefix (-p) or suffix (-s, default) is presented, along
#	with statistics to indicate how useful such an affix might be in
#	reducing the size of the input file.  Only those affixes which
#	produce a legal root (one found in the original input) are reported.
#
#	If the "-c" option is not given, the output lines are in the
#	following format:
#
#		strip/add/count/bytes
#
#	where "strip" is the string that should be stripped from a root
#	word before adding the affix, "add" is the affix to be added, "count"
#	is a count of the number of times that this "strip/add" combination
#	appears, and "bytes" is an estimate of the number of bytes that
#	will be saved in the raw dictionary file if this combination is
#	added to the affix file.  The field separator in the output will
#	normally be the tab character specified by the "-t" switch;  the
#	default is a slash ("/").
#
#	If the "-c" ("clean output") option is given, the appearance of
#	the output is made cleaner by changing it to:
#
#		-strip+add<tab>count<tab>bytes
#
#	where "strip," "add," "count," and "bytes" are as before, and "<tab>"
#	represents the ASCII tab character.
#
#	The method used to generate possible affixes will also generate
#	longer affixes which have common headers or trailers.  For example,
#	the two words "moth" and "mother" will generate not only the obvious
#	substition "+er" but also "-h+her" and "-th+ther" (and possibly
#	even longer ones, depending on the value of "min").  To prevent
#	cluttering the output with such affixes, any affix pair that shares
#	a common header (or, for prefixes, trailer) string longer than
#	"elim" characters (default 1) will be suppressed.  You may want to
#	set "elim" to a value greater than 1 if your language has string
#	characters;  usually the need for this parameter will become obvious
#	when you examine the output of your findaffix run.
#
#	Normally, the output is sorted on the "bytes" field.  If the "-f"
#	flag is given, the output is sorted according to the "count" field.
#
#	No affix longer than "max" characters (default 8) will be reported.
#	Smaller values of "max" will make the script run faster.
#
#	Affixes which appear fewer than "low" times (default 10) are
#	suppressed.  This significantly reduces the size of the output file.
#
#	Affixes which generate stems shorter than "min" characters (default 3)
#	are suppressed.  (A stem is the word after the "strip" string has
#	been removed, and before the "add" string has been added.)  This
#	reduces both the running time and the size of the output file.  "Min"
#	should only be set to 1 if you have a *lot* of free time and disk
#	space.
#
#	The script requires a non-blank field-separator character for internal
#	use.  Normally, this character is a slash ("/"), but if the slash
#	appears as a character in the input word list, a different character
#	can be specified with the "-t" switch.
#
#	If the input files are ispell dictionaries, they should be expanded
#	before being fed to this script.
#
#	If the input files contains characters other than [A-Za-z], they
#	should be translated to lowercase before being fed to this script.

#
# Now the monstrous pipeline.  The awk command produces several lines for
# each input word.  Each line contains a possible stem (first field),
# a possible affix, and the length of the original word.  The loop which
# does this was placed into the LOOP variable by the code above (q.v.).
#
# The first sort puts this output into an order appropriate for feeding
# to 'join'.  The join command then combines stems and affixes, and for
# each puts out an affix to strip, an affix to add, and the length of
# the word before and after modification.
#
# From here on out the job is relatively easy.  The second 'awk' gets rid
# of lines that have the same strip and add affixes, and also eliminates
# lines where the strip and add affix have a common leading (for suffixes)
# or trailing (for prefixes) substring, or where the strip affix is longer
# than the add affix (this is all done by the $ELIM variable, which is also
# set up by the code above.  The second sort collects identical affixes;
# the third 'awk' functions like 'uniq -c', replacing duplicate affixes
# with a count and summing the estimate of bytes saved.  It also eliminates
# any affixes which appear less frequently than the minimum ("lowcount").
# Finally, the third sort ($finalsortopts) rearranges the list in the chosen
# sort order.
