I see you've never used this version of Pnews before.  I will give you extra
help this first time through, but then you must remember what you learned.
If you don't understand any question, type h and a CR (carriage return) for
help.

If you've never posted an article to the net before, it is HIGHLY recommended
that you read the netiquette document found in news.announce.newusers so
that you'll know to avoid the commonest blunders.  To do that, interrupt
Pnews, and get to the top-level prompt of rn.  Type "g news.announce.newusers"
and you are on your way.

A temporary file has been created for you to edit.  Be sure to leave at
least one blank line between the header and the body of your message.
(And until a certain bug is fixed all over the net, don't start the body of
your message with any indentation, or it may get eaten.)

Within the header may be fields that you don't understand.  If you don't
understand a field (or even if you do), you can simply leave it blank, and
it will go away when the article is posted.

Type return to get the default editor, or type the name of your favorite
