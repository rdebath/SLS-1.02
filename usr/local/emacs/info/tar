Preface
*******

This manual describes the GNU tape archiver, `tar', and how you can use
it to store copies of a file or a group of files in an "archive".  This
archive may be written directly to a magnetic tape or other storage
medium, stored as a file, or sent through a pipe to another program.
`tar' can also be used to add files to an already existing archive, list
the files in an archive, or extract the files in the archive.



GNU `tar' was written by John Gilmore, and modified by many people.  The
GNU enhancements were written by Jay Fenlason.


Using the Tape Archiver
***********************

You can use the GNU tape archiver, `tar', to store copies of a file or a
group of files in an "archive".  This archive may be written directly to
a magnetic tape or other storage medium, stored as a file, or sent
through a pipe to another program.  `tar' can also be used to add files
to an already existing archive, list the files in an archive, or extract
the files in the archive.

The Uses of Tape Archives
*************************

The tape archiver `tar' allows you to store many files in an "archive
file" or "tar file" which describes the names and contents of the
constituent files.  Later you can extract some or all of these files
from the archive.

Tar files are not restricted to magnetic tapes.  The `tar' program can
equally well use an ordinary file, or a pipe, or any device, as the
archive.  But they were originally designed for use with magnetic tapes,
and that is how the name "tar" came about.

Archive files can be used for transporting a group of files from one
system to another: put all relevant files into an archive on one
computer system, transfer the archive to another, and extract the
contents there.  The basic transfer medium might be magnetic tape,
Internet FTP, or even electronic mail (though you must encode the
archive with `uuencode' in order to transport it properly by mail).
Both machines do not have to use the same operating system, as long as
they both support the `tar' program.

A magnetic tape can store several files in sequence, but has no names
for them, just relative position on the tape.  A tar file or something
like it is the only way to store several files on one tape and retain
their names.  Even when the basic transfer mechanism can keep track of
names, as FTP can, the nuisance of handling multiple files, directories,
and multiple links, may make a tar file a much easier method.

Archive files are also used for long-term storage, which you can think
of as transportation from one time to another.

Piping one `tar' to another is an easy way to copy a directory's
contents from one disk to another, while preserving the dates, modes,
owners and link-structure of all the files therein.

The GNU version of `tar' has special features that allow it to be used
to make incremental and full dumps of all the files in a filesystem.

The Different Operations `tar' Can Perform
******************************************

One program, `tar', is used to create an archive, to extract files from
an archive, to modify an archive, or to list the contents.  Each time
you run `tar', you must give a "command" to specify which one of these
things you want to do.

The command must always be in the first argument to `tar'.  This
argument can also contain options (*Note Options::).  For compatibility
with Unix `tar', the first argument is always treated as containing
command and option letters even if it doesn't start with `-'.  Thus,
`tar c' is equivalent to `tar -c': both of them specify the `-c' command
to create an archive.

In addition, a set of long-named options are provided which can be used
instead of or inter-mixed with the single-letter flags.  The long-named
options are meant to be easy to remember and logical, while the single
letter flags may not always be.  Long-named options are preceded by a
`+'.  In the list of single-letter commands below, each corresponding
long-named option is listed next to it, in parentheses.

The remaining arguments to `tar' are either options, if they start with
`-' or `+', or files to operate on.

The file names that you give as arguments are the files that `tar' will
act on -- for example, they are the files to put in the archive, or the
files to extract from it.  If you don't give any file name arguments,
the default depends on which command you used.  Some commands use all
relevant files; some commands have no default and will report an error
if you don't specify files.

If a file name argument actually names a directory, then that directory
and all files and subdirectories in it are used.

Here is a list of all the `tar' commands:

`-c'
`+create'
     This command tells `tar' to create a new archive that contains the
     file(s) specified on the command line.  If you don't specify files,
     all the files in the current directory are used.

     If the archive file already exists, it is overwritten; the old
     contents are lost.

`-d'
`+compare'
`+diff'
     This command causes `tar' to compare the archive with the files in
     the file system.  It will report differences in file size, mode,
     owner, and contents.  If a file exists in the archive, but not in
     the file system, `tar' will report this.

     If you specify file names, those files are compared with the tape
     and they must all exist in the archive.  If you don't specify
     files, all the files in the archive are compared.

`-r'
`+append'
     This command causes `tar' to add the specified file(s) to the end
     of the archive.  This assumes that the archive file already exists
     and is in the proper format (which probably means it was created
     previously with the `tar' program).  If the archive is not in a
     format that `tar' understands, the results will be unpredictable.

     You must specify the files to be used; there is no default.

`-t'
`+list'
     This command causes `tar' to display a list of the files in the
     archive.  If you specify file names, only the files that you
     specify will be mentioned (but each of them is mentioned only if it
     appears in the archive).

`-u'
`+update'
     This command causes `tar' to add the specified files to the end of
     the archive, like `-r', but only when a file doesn't already
     exist in the archive or is newer than the version in the archive
     (the last-modification time is compared).  Adding files to the end of an
     archive can be very slow.

     You must specify the files to be used; there is no default.

`-x'
`+extract'
`+get'
     This command causes `tar' to extract the specified files from the
     archive.  If no file names are given, all the files in the archive
     will be extracted.

`-A'
`+catenate'
`+concatenate'
     This command is used for concatenating several archive files into
     one big archive file.  The files to operate on should all be
     archive files.  They are all appended to the end of *the* archive
     file which `tar' works on.  (The other files are not changed).

     You might be tempted to use `cat' for this, but it won't ordinarily
     work.  A `tar' archive contains data which indicates the end of the
     archive, so more material added to the end with `cat' would be
     ignored.  This command works because it removes the end-of-archive
     markers from the middle of the result.

`-D'
`+delete'
     This command causes `tar' to delete the specified files from the
     archive.  This command is extremely slow.  Warning: Use of this
     command on archives stored on magnetic tape may result in a
     scrambled archive.  There is no safe way (except for completely
     re-writing the archive) to delete files from a magnetic tape.

Options That Change How `tar' Works
***********************************

Options may be specified as individual arguments starting with `-'.  In
this case, if the option wants an argument (as does, for example, `-f')
then the argument should come after the option, separated from it by a
space.  All options are optional.  Some options make sense with any
command, while others are meaningful only with particular commands.

* General Options::		Options that are always meaningful.
* Creation Options::		Options for creating or updating an archive.
* Extraction Options::		Options for listing or extracting files.
* Option Syntax::		Old syntax for options

Options That Are Always Meaningful
==================================

`-b NUMBER'
`+block-size NUMBER'
     This option is used to specify a "blocking factor" for the archive.
     When reading or writing the archive, `tar', will do reads and
     writes of the archive in blocks of NUMBER*512 bytes.

     The default blocking factor is set when `tar' is compiled, and is
     typically 20.

     Blocking factors larger than 20 cannot be read by very old versions
     of `tar', or by some newer versions of `tar' running on old
     machines with small address spaces.

     With a magnetic tape, larger blocks give faster throughput and fit
     more data on a tape (because there are fewer inter-record gaps).
     If the archive is in a disk file or a pipe, you may want to specify
     a smaller blocking factor, since a large one will result in a large
     number of null bytes at the end of the archive.

     When writing cartridge or other streaming tapes, a much larger
     blocking factor (say 126 or more) will greatly increase
     performance.  However, you must specify the same blocking factor
     when reading or updating the archive.

     With GNU `tar' the blocking factor is limited only by the maximum
     block size of the device containing the archive, or by the amount
     of available virtual memory.

`-f FILENAME'
`+file FILENAME'
     This option is used to specify the file name of the archive `tar'
     works on.

     If this option is not given, but the environment variable `TAPE' is
     set, its value is used; otherwise, a default archive name (which
     was picked when `tar' was compiled) is used.  The default is
     normally set up to be the "first" tape drive or other transportable
     I/O medium on the system.

     If the filename is `-', `tar' reads the archive from standard input
     (when listing or extracting), or writes it to standard output (when
     creating).  If the `-' filename is given when updating an archive,
     `tar' will read the original archive from its standard input, and
     will write the entire new archive to its standard output.

     If the filename contains `:/dev/', it is interpreted as
     `hostname:filename'.  If the HOSTNAME contains an "at" sign (`@'),
     it is treated as `user@hostname:filename'.  In either case, `tar'
     will invoke the command `rsh' (or `remsh') to start up an
     `/etc/rmt' on the remote machine.  If you give an alternate login
     name, it will be given to the `rsh'.  Naturally, the remote machine
     must have a copy of `/etc/rmt'.  `/etc/rmt' is free software from
     the University of California, and a copy of the source code can be
     found with the sources for `tar'.  `/etc/rmt' will have to be
     modified to run on non-BSD4.3 systems.

`-C DIR'
`+directory DIR'
     This option causes `tar' to change into the directory DIR before
     continuing.  This option is usually interspersed with the files
     `tar' is to work on.  For example,

          tar -c iggy ziggy -C baz melvin

     will place the files `iggy' and `ziggy' from the current directory
     on the tape, followed by the file `melvin' from the directory
     `baz'.  This option is especially useful when you have several
     widely separated files that you want to store in the same directory
     in the archive.

     Note that the file `melvin' is recorded in the archive under the
     precise name `melvin', *not* `baz/melvin'.  Thus, the archive will
     contain three files that all appear to have come from the same
     directory; if the archive is extracted with plain `tar -x', all
     three files will be created in the current directory.

     Contrast this with the command

          tar -c iggy ziggy bar/melvin

     which records the third file in the archive under the name
     `bar/melvin' so that, if plain `tar -x' is used, the third file
     will be created in a subdirectory named `bar'.

`-M'
`+multi-volume'
     This option causes `tar' to write a "multi-volume" archive--one
     that may be larger than will fit on the medium used to hold it.

     When this option is used, `tar' will not abort when it cannot read
     or write any more data.  Instead, it will ask you to prepare a new
     volume.  If the archive is on a magnetic tape, you should change
     tapes now; if the archive is on a floppy disk, you should change
     disks, etc.

     Each volume of a multi-volume archive is an independent tar
     archive, complete in itself.  For example, you can list or extract
     any volume alone (just don't specify `-M').  However, if one file
     in the archive is split across volumes, the only way to extract it
     successfully is with a multi-volume extract command (`-xM')
     starting on or before the volume where the file begins.

`-N DATE'
`+after-date DATE'
     This option causes `tar' to only work on files whose modification
     or inode-changed times are newer than the DATE given.  The main use
     is for creating an archive; then only new files are written.  If
     extracting, only newer files are extracted.

     Remember that the entire date argument should be quoted if it
     contains any spaces.

     The date is parsed using `getdate'.

`-R'
`+record-number'
     If `-R' is used, `tar' prints, along with every message it would
     normally produce, the record number within the archive where the
     message occurred.  This option is especially useful when reading
     damaged archives, since it helps pinpoint the damaged sections.

     This can also be useful when making a log of a file-system backup
     tape, since the results allow you to find the file you want to
     retrieve on several backup tapes and choose the tape where the file
     appears earliest (closest to the front of the tape).

`-T FILENAME'
`+files-from FILENAME'
     Instead of taking the list of files to work on from the command
     line, the list of files to work on is read from the file FILENAME.
     If FILENAME is given as `-', the list is read from standard input.
     Note that using both `-T -' and `-f -' will not work unless you are
     using the `-c' command.

`-v'
`+verbose'
     This option causes `tar' to be verbose about the actions it is
     taking.

     Normally, the `-t' command to list an archive prints just the file
     names (one per line) and the other commands are silent.

     `-tv' prints a full line of information about each file, like the
     output of `ls -l'.  `-v' with any other command (aside from `-t')
     prints just the name of each file operated on.

     The output from `-v' appears on the standard output except when
     creating or updating an archive to the standard output, in which
     case the output from `-v' is sent to the standard error.

`+version'

     This option causes `tar' to print out its version number to the
     standard error.  It has no equivalent short option name.

`-w'
`+interactive'
     This option causes `tar' to print a message for each action it
     intends to take, and ask for confirmation on the terminal.  To
     confirm, you must type a line of input.  If your input line begins
     with `y', the action is performed, otherwise it is skipped.

     The actions which require confirmation include adding a file to the
     archive, extracting a file from the archive, deleting a file from
     the archive, and deleting a file from disk.

     If `tar' is reading the archive from the standard input, `tar' will
     open the file `/dev/tty' to ask for confirmation on.

`-X FILE'
`+exclude FILE'
     This option causes `tar' to read a list of filename regular
     expressions, one per line, from the file FILE; `tar' will ignore
     files with those names.  Thus if `tar' is called as `tar -c -X foo
     .' and the file `foo' contains `*.o' none of the files whose names
     end in `.o' in the current directory (or any subdirectory of the
     current directory) will be added to the archive.  Multiple `-X'
     options may be given.

`-z'
`-Z'
`+compress'
`+uncompress'
     The archive should be compressed as it is written, or decompressed
     as it is read, using the `compress' program.  This option works on
     physical devices (tape drives, etc.) and remote files as well as on
     normal files; data to or from such devices or remote files is
     reblocked by another copy of the `tar' program to enforce the
     specified (or default) block size.  The default compression
     parameters are used; if you need to override them, avoid the `-z'
     option and run `compress' explicitly.

     If the `-z' option is given twice, or the `+compress-block' option
     is used, `tar' will pad the archive out to the next block boundry
     (*Note General Options::).  This may be useful with some devices
     that require that all write operations be a multiple of a certain
     size.

     Note that the `-z' option will not work with the `-M' option, or
     with the `-u', `-r', `-A', or `-D' commands.

Options for Creating Or Updating an Archive
===========================================

These options are used to control which files `tar' puts in an archive,
or to control the format the archive is written in (*Note Format::).

Except as noted below, these options are useful with the `-c', `-r',
`-u', `-A', and `-D' commands.  Also note that the `-B' option, (*Note
Extraction Options::), is also useful with the `-r', `-u', `-A', and
`-D' commands.

`-G'
`+incremental'
     This option should only be used when creating an incremental backup
     of a filesystem.  When the `-G' option is used, `tar' writes, at
     the beginning of the archive, an entry for each of the directories
     that will be operated on.  The entry for a directory includes a
     list of all the files in the directory at the time the dump was
     done, and a flag for each file indicating whether the file is going
     to be put in the archive.  This information is used when doing a
     complete incremental restore.

     Note that this option causes `tar' to create a non-standard archive
     that may not be readable by non-GNU versions of the `tar' program.

`-h'
`+dereference'
     If `-h' is used, when `tar' encounters a symbolic link, it will
     archive the linked-to file, instead of simply recording the
     presence of a symbolic link.  If the linked-to file is archived
     again, an entire second copy of it will be archived, instead of a
     link.  This could be considered a bug.

`-l'
`+one-file-system'
     This option causes `tar' to not cross filesystem boundaries when
     archiving parts of a directory tree.  This option only affects
     files that are archived because they are in a directory that is
     archived; files named on the command line are archived regardless,
     and they can be from various file systems.

     This option is useful for making full or incremental archival
     backups of a file system, as with the Unix `dump' command.

     Files which are skipped due to this option are mentioned on the
     standard error.

`-o'
`+old-archive'
`+old'
`+portability'
     This option causes `tar' to write an old format archive, which does
     not include information about directories, pipes, fifos, contiguous
     files, or device files, and specifies file ownership by numeric
     user- and group-ids rather than by user and group names.  In most
     cases, a *new* format archive can be read by an *old* `tar' program
     without serious trouble, so this option should seldom be needed.
     When updating an archive, do not use `-o' unless the archive was
     created with the `-o' option.

`-S'
`+sparse'
     This option causes all files to be put in the archive to be tested
     for sparseness, and handled specially if they are.  The `-S' option
     is useful when many dbm files, for example, are being backed up,
     and running out of space on the tape is an issue.  Using this
     option dramatically decreases the amount of space needed to store
     such a file.

     In later versions, this option may be removed, and the testing and
     treatment of sparse files may be done automatically with any
     special GNU options.  For now, it is an option needing to be
     specified on the command line with the creation or updating of an
     archive.

`-V NAME'
`+volume NAME'
     This option causes `tar' to write out a "volume header" at the
     beginning of the archive.  If `-M' is used, each volume of the
     archive will have a volume header of `NAME Volume N', where N is 1
     for the first volume, 2 for the next, and so on.

`-W'
`+verify'
     This option causes `tar' to verify the archive after writing it.
     Each volume is checked after it is written, and any discrepancies
     are recorded on the standard error output.

     Verification requires that the archive be on a back-space-able
     medium.  This means pipes, some cartridge tape drives, and some
     other devices cannot be verified.

Options for Listing Or Extracting Files
=======================================

The options in this section are meaningful with the `-x' command.
Unless otherwise stated, they are also meaningful with the `-t' command.

`-B'
`+read-full-blocks'
     If `-B' is used, `tar' will not panic if an attempt to read a block
     from the archive does not return a full block.  Instead, `tar' will
     keep reading until it has obtained a full block.

     This option is turned on by default when `tar' is reading an
     archive from standard input, or from a remote machine.  This is
     because on BSD Unix systems, a read of a pipe will return however
     much happens to be in the pipe, even if it is less than `tar'
     requested.  If this option was not used, `tar' would fail as soon
     as it read an incomplete block from the pipe.

     This option is also useful with the commands for updating an
     archive.

`-G'
`+incremental'
     The `-G' option means the archive is an incremental backup.  Its
     meaning depends on the command that it modifies.

     If the `-G' option is used with `-t', `tar' will list, for each
     directory in the archive, the list of files in that directory at
     the time the archive was created.  This information is put out in a
     format that is not easy for humans to read, but which is
     unambiguous for a program: each filename is preceded by either a
     `Y' if the file is present in the archive, an `N' if the file is
     not included in the archive, or a `D' if the file is a directory
     (and is included in the archive).  Each filename is terminated by a
     null character.  The last file is followed by an additional null
     and a newline to indicate the end of the data.

     If the `-G' option is used with `-x', then when the entry for a
     directory is found, all files that currently exist in that
     directory but are not listed in the archive *are deleted from the
     directory*.

     This behavior is convenient when you are restoring a damaged file
     system from a succession of incremental backups: it restores the
     entire state of the file system to that which obtained when the
     backup was made.  If you don't use `-G', the file system will
     probably fill up with files that shouldn't exist any more.

`-i'
`+ignore-zeros'
     The `-i' option causes `tar' to ignore blocks of zeros in the
     archive.  Normally a block of zeros indicates the end of the
     archive, but when reading a damaged archive, or one which was
     created by `cat'-ing several archives together, this option allows
     `tar' to read the entire archive.  This option is not on by default
     because many versions of `tar' write garbage after the zeroed
     blocks.

     Note that this option causes `tar' to read to the end of the
     archive file, which may sometimes avoid problems when multiple
     files are stored on a single physical tape.

`-k'
`+keep-old-files'
     The `-k' option prevents `tar' from over-writing existing files
     with files with the same name from the archive.

     The `-k' option is meaningless with `-t'.

`-K FILENAME'
`+starting-file FILENAME'
     The `-K' option causes `tar' to begin extracting or listing the
     archive with the file FILENAME, and to consider only the files
     starting at that point in the archive.  This is useful if a
     previous attempt to extract files failed when it reached FILENAME
     due to lack of free space.  (This assumes, of course, that there is
     now free space, or that you are now extracting into a different
     file system.)

`-m'
`+modification-time'
     When this option is used, `tar' leaves the modification times of
     the files it extracts as the time when the files were extracted,
     instead of setting it to the time recorded in the archive.

     This option is meaningless with `-t'.

`-O'
`+to-stdout'
     When this option is used, instead of creating the files specified,
     `tar' writes the contents of the files extracted to its standard
     output.  This may be useful if you are only extracting the files in
     order to send them through a pipe.

     This option is meaningless with `-t'.

`-p'
`+same-permissions'
`+preserve-permissions'
     This option causes `tar' to set the modes (access permissions) of
     extracted files exactly as recorded in the archive.  If this option
     is not used, the current `umask' setting limits the permissions on
     extracted files.

     This option is meaningless with `-t'.

`-P'
`+absolute-paths'
     This option should be used when the absolute pathname of a file
     should be preserved in the archive.  `tar' normally strips the
     leading `/' from the name of the file, thus making /usr/foo/bar/baz
     into usr/foo/bar/baz.  Using the `-P' option keeps the pathname
     intact, and is useful in that it is not necessary to change to the
     root directory when extracting files.

`-s'
`+same-order'
`+preserve-order'
     This option tells `tar' that the list of filenames to be listed or
     extracted is sorted in the same order as the files in the archive.
     This allows a large list of names to be used, even on a small
     machine that would not otherwise be able to hold all the names in
     memory at the same time.  Such a sorted list can easily be created
     by running `tar -t' on the archive and editing its output.

     This option is probably never needed on modern computer systems.

`+preserve'
     The `+preserve' option has no equivalent short option name.  It is
     equivalent to `-p' plus `-s'.

Old Syntax for Options
======================

For compatibility with Unix `tar', the first argument can contain option
letters in addition to the command letter; for example, `tar cv'
specifies the option `-v' in addition to the command `-c'.  The first
argument to GNU `tar' is always treated as command and option letters
even if it doesn't start with `-'.

Some options need their own arguments; for example, `-f' is followed by
the name of the archive file.  When the option is given separately, its
argument follows it, as is usual for Unix programs.  For example:

     tar -c -v -b 20 -f /dev/rmt0

When options that need arguments are given together with the command,
all the associated arguments follow, in the same order as the options.
Thus, the example above could also be written in the old style as
follows:

     tar cvbf 20 /dev/rmt0

Here `20' is the argument of `-b' and `/dev/rmt0' is the argument of
`-f'.

The long-named options can be used instead of the single-letter flags.
They are meant to be obvious and easy to remember, possibly more so than
their corresponding single-letter options.  The above example using
long-named options would look like this:

     tar +create +verbose +block-size +file 20 /dev/rmt0

Using `tar' to Perform Full Dumps ********************************* Full
dumps should only be made when no other people or programs are modifying
files in the filesystem.  If files are modified while `tar' is making
the backup, they may not be stored properly in the archive, in which
case you won't be able to restore them if you have to.

You will want to use the `-V' option to give the archive a volume label,
so you can tell what this archive is even if the label falls off the
tape, or anything like that.

Unless the filesystem you are dumping is guaranteed to fit on one
volume, you will need to use the `-M' option.  Make sure you have enough
tapes on hand to complete the backup.

If you want to dump each filesystem separately you will need to use the
`-l' option to prevent `tar' from crossing filesystem boundaries when
storing (sub)directories.

The `-G' option is not needed, since this is a complete copy of
everything in the filesystem, and a full restore from this backup would
only be done onto a completely empty disk.

Unless you are in a hurry, and trust the `tar' program (and your tapes),
it is a good idea to use the `-W' (verify) option, to make sure your
files really made it onto the dump properly.  This will also detect
cases where the file was modified while (or just after) it was being
archived.

Using `tar' to Perform Incremental Dumps
**************************************** Performing incremental dumps is
similar to performing full dumps, although a few more options will
usually be needed.

You will need to use the `-N DATE' option to tell `tar' to only store
files that have been modified since DATE.  DATE should be the date and
time of the last full/incremental dump.

A standard scheme is to do a `monthly' (full) dump once a month, a
`weekly' dump once a week of everything since the last monthly and a
`daily' every day of everything since the last (weekly or monthly) dump.

Here is a copy of the script used to dump the filesystems of the
machines here at the Free Software Foundation.  This script is run
(semi-)automatically late at night when people are least likely to be
using the machines.  This script dumps several filesystems from several
machines at once (by using a network-filesystem).  The operator is
responsible for ensuring that all the machines will be up at the time
the dump happens.  If a machine is not running, its files will not be
dumped, and the next day's incremental dump will *not* store files that
would have gone onto that dump.

     #!/bin/csh
     # Dump thingie
     set now = `date`
     set then = `cat date.nfs.dump`
     /u/hack/bin/tar -c -G -v\
      -f /dev/rtu20\
      -b 126\
      -N "$then"\
      -V "Dump from $then to $now"\
      /alpha-bits/gp\
      /gnu/hack\
      /hobbes/u\
      /spiff/u\
      /sugar-bombs/u
     echo $now > date.nfs.dump
     mt -f /dev/rtu20 rew

Output from this script is stored in a file, for the operator to read
later.

This script uses the file `date.nfs.dump' to store the date/time of the
last dump.

Since this is a streaming tape drive, no attempt to verify the archive
is done.  This is also why the high blocking factor (126) is used.  The
tape drive must also be rewound by the `mt' command after the dump is
made.

Common Problems Using `tar'
***************************

Unless you use the `-P' option, GNU `tar' will not allow you to create
an archive that contains absolute pathnames.  (An absolute pathname is
one that begins with a `/'.) If you try, `tar' will automatically remove
the leading `/' from the file names it stores in the archive.  It will
also type a warning message telling you what it is doing.

When reading an archive that was created with a different `tar' program,
GNU `tar' automatically extracts entries in the archive which have
absolute pathnames as if the pathnames were not absolute.  If the
archive contained a file `/usr/bin/computoy', GNU `tar' would extract
the file to `usr/bin/computoy' in the current directory.  If you want to
extract the files in an archive to the same absolute names that they had
when the archive was created, you should do a `cd /' before extracting
the files from the archive, or you should either use the `-P' option, or
use the command `tar -C / ...'.

Some versions of UNIX, (Ultrix 3.1 is know to have this problem) can
claim that a short write near the end of a tape succeeded, when it
actually failed.  This will result in the -M option not working
correctly.  The best workaround at the moment is to use a significantly
larger blocksize than the default 20.

In order to update an archive, `tar' must be able to backspace the
archive in order to re-read or re-write a block that was just read (or
written).  This is currently possible only on two kinds of files: normal
disk files (or any other file that can be backspaced with `lseek()'),
and industry-standard 9-track magnetic tape (or any other kind of tape
that can be backspaced with `ioctl(...,MTIOCTOP,...)').

This means that the `-r', `-u', `-A', and `-D' commands will not work on
any other kind of file.  Some media simply cannot be backspaced, which
means these commands and options will never be able to work on them.
These non-backspacing media include pipes and cartridge tape drives.

Some other media can be backspaced, and `tar' will work on them once
`tar' is modified to do so.

Archives created with the `-M', `-V', and `-G' options may not be
readable by other version of `tar'.  In particular, restoring a file
that was split over a volume boundary will require some careful work
with `dd', if it can be done at all.  Other versions of `tar' may also
create an empty file whose name is that of the volume header.  Some
versions of `tar' may create normal files instead of directories
archived with the `-G' option.

The Remote Tape Server ********************** In order to access the
tape drive on a remote machine, `tar' uses the remote tape server
written at the University of California at Berkeley.  The remote tape
server must be installed as `/etc/rmt' on any machine whose tape drive
you want to use.  `tar' calls `/etc/rmt' by running an `rsh' or `remsh'
to the remote machine, optionally using a different login name if one is
supplied.

A copy of the source for the remote tape server is provided.  It is
Copyright (C) 1983 by the Regents of the University of California, but
can be freely distributed.  Instructions for compiling and installing it
are included in the `Makefile'.

The remote tape server may need to be modified in order to run on a
non-4.3BSD system.

The Format of a `tar' Archive ***************************** This chapter
is based heavily on John Gilmore's tar(5) manual page for the public
domain `tar' that GNU `tar' is based on.


The Standard Format =================== A "tar tape" or file contains a
series of records.  Each record contains `RECORDSIZE' bytes.  Although
this format may be thought of as being on magnetic tape, other media are
often used.

Each file archived is represented by a header record which describes the
file, followed by zero or more records which give the contents of the
file.  At the end of the archive file there may be a record filled with
binary zeros as an end-of-file marker.  A reasonable system should write
a record of zeros at the end, but must not assume that such a record
exists when reading an archive.

The records may be "blocked" for physical I/O operations.  Each block of
N records (where N is set by the `-b' option to `tar') is written with a
single `write()' operation.  On magnetic tapes, the result of such a
write is a single tape record.  When writing an archive, the last block
of records should be written at the full size, with records after the
zero record containing all zeroes.  When reading an archive, a
reasonable system should properly handle an archive whose last block is
shorter than the rest, or which contains garbage records after a zero
record.

The header record is defined in C as follows:

     /*
      * Standard Archive Format - Standard TAR - USTAR
      */
     #define RECORDSIZE  	512
     #define NAMSIZ      	100

All characters in header records are represented by using 8-bit
characters in the local variant of ASCII.  Each field within the
structure is contiguous; that is, there is no padding used within the
structure.  Each character on the archive medium is stored contiguously.

Bytes representing the contents of files (after the header record of
each file) are not translated in any way and are not constrained to
represent characters in any character set.  The `tar' format does not
distinguish text files from binary files, and no translation of file
contents is performed.

The `name', `linkname', `magic', `uname', and `gname' are
null-terminated character strings.  All other fileds are zero-filled
octal numbers in ASCII.  Each numeric field of width W contains W minus
2 digits, a space, and a null, except `size', and `mtime', which do not
contain the trailing null.

The `name' field is the pathname of the file, with directory names (if
any) preceding the file name, separated by slashes.

The `mode' field provides nine bits specifying file permissions and
three bits to specify the Set UID, Set GID, and Save Text ("stick")
modes.  Values for these bits are defined above.  When special
permissions are required to create a file with a given mode, and the
user restoring files from the archive does not hold such permissions,
the mode bit(s) specifying those special permissions are ignored.  Modes
which are not supported by the operating system restoring files from the
archive will be ignored.  Unsupported modes should be faked up when
creating or updating an archive; e.g. the group permission could be
copied from the `other' permission.

The `uid' and `gid' fields are the numeric user and group ID of the file
owners, respectively.  If the operating system does not support numeric
user or group IDs, these fields should be ignored.

The `size' field is the size of the file in bytes; linked files are
archived with this field specified as zero.  *Note Extraction Options::;
in particular the `-G' option.

The `mtime' field is the modification time of the file at the time it
was archived.  It is the ASCII representation of the octal value of the
last time the file was modified, represented as an integer number of
seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time.

The `chksum' field is the ASCII representation of the octal value of the
simple sum of all bytes in the header record.  Each 8-bit byte in the
header is added to an unsigned integer, initialized to zero, the
precision of which shall be no less than seventeen bits.  When
calculating the checksum, the `chksum' field is treated as if it were
all blanks.

The `typeflag' field specifies the type of file archived.  If a
particular implementation does not recognize or permit the specified
type, the file will be extracted as if it were a regular file.  As this
action occurs, `tar' issues a warning to the standard error.

The `atime' and `ctime' fields are used in making incremental backups;
they store, respectively, the particular file's access time and last
inode-change time.

The `offset' is used by the -M option, when making a multi-volume
archive.  The offset is number of bytes into the file that we need to
restart at to continue the file on the next tape, i.e., where we store
the location that a continued file is continued at.

The `longnames' field of the header belongs with something that is not
yet implemented in tar, and is therefore empty.

The following fields were added to deal with sparse files.  A file is
"sparse" if it takes in unallocated blocks which end up being
represented as zeros, i.e., no useful data.  A test to see if a file is
sparse is to look at the number blocks allocated for it versus the
number of characters in the file; if there are fewer blocks allocated
for the file than would normally be allocated for a file of that size,
then the file is sparse.  This is the method tar uses to detect a sparse
file, and once such a file is detected, it is treated differently from
non-sparse files.

Sparse files are often dbm files, or other database-type files which
have data at some points and emptiness in the greater part of the file.
Such files can appear to be very large when an `ls -l' is done on them,
when in truth, there may be a very small amount of important data
contained in the file.  It is thus undesirable to have tar think that it
must back up this entire file, as great quantities of room are wasted on
empty blocks, which can lead to running out of room on a tape far
earlier than is necessary.  Thus, sparse files are dealt with so that
these empty blocks are not written to the tape.  Instead, what is
written to the tape is a description, of sorts, of the sparse file:
where the holes are, how big the holes are, and how much data is found
at the end of the hole.  This way, the file takes up potentially far
less room on the tape, and when the file is extracted later on, it will
look exactly the way it looked beforehand.  The following is a
description of the fields used to handle a sparse file:

The `sp' is an array of `struct sparse'.  Each `struct sparse' contains
two 12-character strings which represent an offset into the file and a
number of bytes to be written at that offset.  The offset is absolute,
and not relative to the offset in preceding array element.

The header can hold four of these `struct sparse' at the moment; if more
are needed, they are not stored in the header.

The `isextended' flag is set when an `extended_header' is needed to deal
with a file.  Note that this means that this flag can only be set when
dealing with a sparse file, and it is only set in the event that the
description of the file will not fit in the alloted room for sparse
structures in the header.  In other words, an extended_header is needed.

The `extended_header' structure is used for sparse files which need more
sparse structures than can fit in the header.  The header can fit 4 such
structures; if more are needed, the flag `isextended' gets set and the
next record is an `extended_header'.

Each `extended_header' structure contains an array of 21 sparse
structures, along with a similar `isextended' flag that the header had.
There can be an indeterminate number of such `extended_header's to
describe a sparse file.

`LF_NORMAL'
`LF_OLDNORMAL'
     These flags represent a regular file.  In order to be compatible
     with older versions of `tar', a `typeflag' value of `LF_OLDNORMAL'
     should be silently recognized as a regular file.  New archives
     should be created using `LF_NORMAL'.  Also, for backward
     compatibility, `tar' treats a regular file whose name ends with a
     slash as a directory.

`LF_LINK'
     This flag represents a file linked to another file, of any type,
     previously archived.  Such files are identified in Unix by each
     file having the same device and inode number.  The linked-to name
     is specified in the `linkname' field with a trailing null.

`LF_SYMLINK'
     This represents a symbolic link to another file.  The linked-to
     name is specified in the `linkname' field with a trailing null.

`LF_CHR'
`LF_BLK'
     These represent character special files and block special files
     respectively.  In this case the `devmajor' and `devminor' fields
     will contain the major and minor device numbers respectively.
     Operating systems may map the device specifications to their own
     local specification, or may ignore the entry.

`LF_DIR'
     This flag specifies a directory or sub-directory.  The directory
     name in the `name' field should end with a slash.  On systems where
     disk allocation is performed on a directory basis, the `size' field
     will contain the maximum number of bytes (which may be rounded to
     the nearest disk block allocation unit) which the directory may
     hold.  A `size' field of zero indicates no such limiting.  Systems
     which do not support limiting in this manner should ignore the
     `size' field.

`LF_FIFO'
     This specifies a FIFO special file.  Note that the archiving of a
     FIFO file archives the existence of this file and not its contents.

`LF_CONTIG'
     This specifies a contiguous file, which is the same as a normal
     file except that, in operating systems which support it, all its
     space is allocated contiguously on the disk.  Operating systems
     which do not allow contiguous allocation should silently treat this
     type as a normal file.

`'A' ...'
`'Z''
     These are reserved for custom implementations.  Some of these are
     used in the GNU modified format, as described below.

Other values are reserved for specification in future revisions of the
P1003 standard, and should not be used by any `tar' program.

The `magic' field indicates that this archive was output in the P1003
archive format.  If this field contains `TMAGIC', the `uname' and
`gname' fields will contain the ASCII representation of the owner and
group of the file respectively.  If found, the user and group ID
represented by these names will be used rather than the values within
the `uid' and `gid' fields.


GNU Extensions to the Archive Format
==================================== The GNU format uses additional file
types to describe new types of files in an archive.  These are listed
below.

`LF_DUMPDIR'
`'D''
     This represents a directory and a list of files created by the `-G'
     option.  The `size' field gives the total size of the associated
     list of files.  Each filename is preceded by either a `'Y'' (the
     file should be in this archive) or an `'N'' (The file is a
     directory, or is not stored in the archive).  Each filename is
     terminated by a null.  There is an additional null after the last
     filename.

`LF_MULTIVOL'
`'M''
     This represents a file continued from another volume of a
     multi-volume archive created with the `-M' option.  The original
     type of the file is not given here.  The `size' field gives the
     maximum size of this piece of the file (assuming the volume does
     not end before the file is written out).  The `offset' field gives
     the offset from the beginning of the file where this part of the
     file begins.  Thus `size' plus `offset' should equal the original
     size of the file.

`LF_SPARSE'
`'S''
     This flag indicates that we are dealing with a sparse file.  Note
     that archiving a sparse file requires special operations to find
     holes in the file, which mark the positions of these holes, along
     with the number of bytes of data to be found after the hole.

`LF_VOLHDR'
`'V''
     This file type is used to mark the volume header that was given
     with the `-V' option when the archive was created.  The `name'
     field contains the `name' given after the `-V' option.  The `size'
     field is zero.  Only the first file in each volume of an archive
     should have this type.


You may have trouble reading a GNU format archive on a non-GNU system if
the options `-G', `-M', `-S', or `-V' were used when writing the
archive.  In general, if tar does not use the GNU-added fields of the
header, other versions of tar should be able to read the archive.
Otherwise, the tar program will give an error, the most likely one being
a checksum error.
