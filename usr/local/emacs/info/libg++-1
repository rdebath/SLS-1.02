Release 1.39 Copying Conditions
*******************************

   This section is the license document applicable to the (now
obsolete) version 1.39 of the GNU C++ library.  See the next section,
GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, for the license applicable from
Release 2.0 of the GNU C++ library onwards.

GNU CC GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
=============================

                          (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)

   The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share GNU CC.  To make sure that
you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions
that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of GNU CC, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change GNU CC or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of GNU CC, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for GNU CC.  If GNU CC is modified
by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what
they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on our reputation.

   Therefore we (Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation,
Inc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be
allowed to distribute or change GNU CC.

COPYING POLICIES
================

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of GNU CC source code
     as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
     and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright notice
     "Copyright (C) 1988 Free Software Foundation, Inc." (or with
     whatever year is appropriate); keep intact the notices on all
     files that refer to this License Agreement and to the absence of
     any warranty; and give any other recipients of the GNU CC program
     a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.  You may
     charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a
     copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of GNU CC or any portion of it,
     and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of
     Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

        * cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
          that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

        * cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
          that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of GNU
          CC or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all
          third parties on terms identical to those contained in this
          License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more
          extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties,
          at your option).

        * You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
          transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
          warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

        Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this
     program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or
     distribution medium does not bring the other program under the
     scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute GNU CC (or any portion of it in under
     Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

        * accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

        * accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
          shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
          corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms
          of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

        * accompany it with the information you received as to where
          the corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This
          alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
          and only if you received the program in object code or
          executable form alone.)

        For an executable file, complete source code means all the
     source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
     exception, it need not include source code for modules which are
     standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which
     the executable file runs.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU CC
     except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer GNU
     CC is void and your rights to use the program under this License
     agreement shall be automatically terminated.  However, parties
     who have received computer software programs from you with this
     License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long
     as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of GNU CC into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
     the Free Software Foundation at 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA
     02139.  We have not yet worked out a simple rule that can be
     stated here, but we will often permit this.  We will be guided by
     the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
     our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
     software.

   Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
software are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation,
Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, or call (617) 876-3296.

NO WARRANTY
===========

   BECAUSE GNU CC IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY NO
WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC,
RICHARD M. STALLMAN AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE GNU CC "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF GNU CC IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD GNU CC PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL RICHARD M. 
STALLMAN, THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC., AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE GNU CC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS) GNU CC, EVEN
IF YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR
ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**********************************

                           Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
      numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility
programs.  This license, the GNU Library General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries.  This license is quite
different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't
assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is
that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or
adding to a program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a
library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using
the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or
application program.  However, in a textual and legal sense, the
linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original
library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended
to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to
achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The
hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
     contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
     authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
     this Library General Public License (also called "this License").
      Each licensee is addressed as "you".

        A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or
     data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
     programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
     executables.

        The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
     work which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based
     on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work
     under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
     Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
     and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
     (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
     term "modification".)

        "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
     any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
     to control compilation and installation of the library.

        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
     are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The
     act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and
     output from such a program is covered only if its contents
     constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of
     the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
     depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
     the Library does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
     that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
     intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
     absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
     along with the Library.

        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
     copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
     exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. The modified work must itself be a software library.

       b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any
          change.

       c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
          charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
          or a table of data to be supplied by an application program
          that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
          when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good
          faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
          does not supply such function or table, the facility still
          operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
          meaningful.

             (For example, a function in a library to compute square
          roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined
          independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d
          requires that any application-supplied function or table
          used by this function must be optional: if the application
          does not supply it, the square root function must still
          compute square roots.)

        These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and
     separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
     do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
     separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
     part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
     distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
     whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
     and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

        Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Library.

        In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. 
     To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
     License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
     License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer
     version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
     has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
     wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.

        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible
     for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies
     to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.

  5. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
     form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
     accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange.

        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to
     copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
     copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
     requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
     parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
     object code.

  6. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
     compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
     Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
     the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
     License.

        However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the
     Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
     (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
     "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore
     covered by this License.  Section 6 states terms for distribution
     of such executables.

        When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a
     header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the
     work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the
     source code is not.  Whether this is true is especially
     significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
     the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true
     is not precisely defined by law.

        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the
     object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally
     a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
     portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
     Section 6.  Any executables containing that work also fall under
     Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
     Library itself.

  7. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.

        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that
     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
     covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.
      If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you
     must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
     well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this
     License.  Also, you must do one of these things:

       a. Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
          machine-readable source code for the Library including
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
          distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
          is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
          machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object
          code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the
          Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
          containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the
          user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
          Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the
          application to use the modified definitions.)

       b. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
          three years, to give the same user the materials specified
          in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost
          of performing this distribution.

       c. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to
          copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
          copy the above specified materials from the same place.

       d. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
          materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

        For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
     exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
     that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
     with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
     component itself accompanies the executable.

        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
     cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
     that you distribute.

  8. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
     library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
     such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
     of the work based on the Library and of the other library
     facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
     two things:

       a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
          based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
          facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
          Sections above.

       b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
          that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of
          the same work.

  9. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
     the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
     your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
     received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
     full compliance.

 10. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
     based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

 11. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
     Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not
     impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
     the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
     compliance by third parties to this License.

 12. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
     distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license
     would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
     then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
     would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

        If any portion of this section is held invalid or
     unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
     the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is
     intended to apply in other circumstances.

        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
     infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
     validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
     protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system
     which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people
     have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
     distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
     application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
     decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
     other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
     believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

 13. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Library under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 14. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. 
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

        Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Library specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 15. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with
     these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software
     which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to
     the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for
     this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
     the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
     promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                                  NO WARRANTY

 16. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 17. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS
     OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH
     ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
==============================================

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
of the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. 
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE LIBRARY'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Library General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
     Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
     library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1990
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   That's all there is to it!

Installing GNU C++ library
**************************

  1. Read through the README file and the Makefile. Make sure that all
     paths, system-dependent compile switches, and program names are
     correct.

  2. Check that files  `values.h', `stdio.h', and `math.h' declare and
     define values appropriate for your system.

  3. Type `make all' to compile the library, test, and install. 
     Current details about contents of the tests and utilities are in
     the `README' file.

Trouble in Installation
***********************

   Here are some of the things that have caused trouble for people
installing GNU C++ library.

  1. Make sure that your GNU C++ version number is at least as high as
     your libg++ version number. For example, libg++ 1.22.0 requires
     g++ 1.22.0 or later releases.

  2. Double-check system constants in the header files mentioned above.

GNU C++ library aims, objectives, and limitations
*************************************************

   The GNU C++ library, libg++ is an attempt to provide a variety of
C++ programming tools and other support to GNU C++ programmers.

   Differences in distribution policy are only part of the difference
between libg++.a and AT&T libC.a.  libg++ is not intended to be an
exact clone of libC. For one, libg++ contains bits of code that depend
on special features of GNU g++ that are either different or lacking in
the AT&T version, including slightly different inlining and overloading
strategies, dynamic local arrays, wrappers, etc.  All of these
differences are minor. For example, while the AT&T and GNU stream
classes are implemented in very different ways, the vast majority of
C++ programs compile and run under either version with no visible
difference. Additionally, all g++-specific constructs are conditionally
compiled; The library is designed to be compatible with any 2.0 C++
compiler.

   libg++ has also contained workarounds for some limitations in g++:
both g++ and libg++ are still undergoing rapid development and testing
-- a task that is helped tremendously by the feedback of active users.

   libg++ is not the only freely available source of C++ class
libraries.  The most notable alternative sources are Interviews and
OOPS. (A g++-compatible version of OOPS is currently available on
prep.ai.mit.edu.  InterViews has been available on the X-windows X11
tapes and also from interviews.stanford.edu.)

   As every C++ programmer knows, the design (moreso than the
implementation) of a C++ class library is something of a challenge. 
Part of the reason is that C++ supports two, partially incompatible,
styles of object-oriented programming -- The "forest" approach,
involving a collection of free-standing classes that can be mixed and
matched, versus the completely hierarchical (smalltalk style)
approach, in which all classes are derived from a common ancestor.  Of
course, both styles have advantages and disadvantages.  So far, libg++
has adopted the "forest" approach.  Keith Gorlen's OOPS library adopts
the hierarchical approach, and may be an attractive alternative for C++
programmers who prefer this style.

   Currently (and/or in the near future) libg++ provides support for a
few basic kinds of classes:

   The first kind of support provides an interface between C++
programs and C libraries. This includes basic header files (like
`stdio.h') as well as things like the File and stream classes. Other
classes that interface to other aspects of C libraries (like those
that maintain environmental information) are in various stages of
development; all will undergo implementation modifications when the
forthcoming GNU libc library is released.

   The second kind of support contains general-purpose basic classes
that transparently manage variable-sized objects on the freestore. 
This includes Obstacks, multiple-precision Integers and Rationals,
arbitrary length Strings, BitSets, and BitStrings.

   Third, several classes and utilities of common interest (e.g.,
Complex numbers) are provided.

   Fourth, a set of pseudo-generic prototype files are available as a
mechanism for generating common container classes. These are described
in more detail in the introduction to container prototypes. Currently,
only a the textual substitution mechanism is available for generic
class creation.

GNU C++ library stylistic conventions
*************************************

   * C++ source files have file extension `.cc'. Both C-compatibility
     header files and class declaration files have extension `.h'.

   * C++ class names begin with capital letters, except for `istream'
     and `ostream', for AT&T C++ compatibility. Multi-word class names
     capitalize each word, with no underscore separation.

   * Include files that define C++ classes begin with capital letters
     (as do the names of the classes themselves).  `stream.h' is
     uncapitalized for AT&T C++ compatibility.

   * Include files that supply function prototypes for other C
     functions (system calls and libraries) are all lower case.

   * All include files define a preprocessor variable _X_h, where X is
     the name of the file, and conditionally compile only if this has
     not been already defined. The `#pragma once' facility is also
     used to avoid re-inclusion.

   * Structures and objects that must be publicly defined, but are not
     intended for public use have names beginning with an underscore.
     (for example, the `_Srep' struct, which is used only by the
     String and SubString classes.)

   * The underscore is used to separate components of long function
     names, 
     e.g., `set_File_exception_handler()'.

   * When a function could be usefully defined either as a member or a
     friend, it is generally a member if it modifies and/or returns
     itself, else it is a friend. There are cases where naturalness of
     expression wins out over this rule.

   * Class declaration files are formatted so that it is easy to
     quickly check them to determine function names, parameters, and
     so on. Because of the different kinds of things that may appear
     in class declarations, there is no perfect way to do this. Any
     suggestions on developing a common class declaration formatting
     style are welcome.

   * All classes use the same simple error (exception) handling
     strategy.  Almost every class has a member function named
     `error(char* msg)' that invokes an associated error handler
     function via a pointer to that function, so that the error
     handling function may be reset by programmers. By default nearly
     all call `*lib_error_handler', which prints the message and then
     aborts execution. This system is subject to change. In general,
     errors are assumed to be non-recoverable: Library classes do not
     include code that allows graceful continuation after exceptions.

Support for representation invariants
*************************************

   Most GNU C++ library classes possess a method named `OK()', that is
useful in helping to verify correct performance of class operations.

   The `OK()' operations checks the "representation invariant" of a
class object. This is a test to check whether the object is in a valid
state. In effect, it is a (sometimes partial) verification of the
library's promise that (1) class operations always leave objects in
valid states, and (2) the class protects itself so that client
functions cannot corrupt this state.

   While no simple validation technique can assure that all operations
perform correctly, calls to `OK()' can at least verify that operations
do not corrupt representations. For example for `String a, b, c; ... a
= b + c;', a call to `a.OK();' will guarantee that `a' is a valid
`String', but does not guarantee that it contains the concatenation of
`b + c'. However, given that `a' is known to be valid, it is possible
to further verify its properties, for example via `a.after(b) == c &&
a.before(c) == b'. In other words, `OK()' generally checks only those
internal representation properties that are otherwise inaccessible to
users of the class. Other class operations are often useful for
further validation.

   Failed calls to `OK()' call a class's `error' method if one exists,
else the directly call `abort'. Failure indicates an implementation
error that should be reported.

   With only rare exceptions, the internal support functions for a
class never themselves call `OK()' (although many of the test files in
the distribution call `OK()' extensively).

   Verification of representational invariants can sometimes be very
time consuming for complicated data structures.
