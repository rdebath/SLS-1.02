UPGRADE NOTICE

You are now using nn release 6.4.

The major change from release 6.3 is that the ~/.nn/rc file is no
longer used, since release 6.4 uses the standard .newsrc file to store
information about which groups you subscribe to and which articles you
have read.

Since you have no .newsrc file already, your current rc file will now
be converted into a .newsrc automatically...
