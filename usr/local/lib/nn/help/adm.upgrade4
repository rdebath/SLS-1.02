UPGRADE NOTICE (continued)

Since you did not want to use the current .newsrc file although it is
newer than the .nn/rc file, you will now have the option to let nn
convert the rc file to .newsrc format and replace the current .newsrc
with the result.

The existing .newsrc file will be saved in .newsrc.old, so you will
still have the opportunity to go back to using the current .newsrc
file, or merge it with the .newsrc file created by nn if you have
special requirements.
