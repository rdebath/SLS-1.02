# mkhostpath - build a pathalias database from a 'hosts' table
#
# Usage: mkhostpath [-n netname] [-c cost] [-g gateway] [-d] [ - | filename ]
#
#	-n netname	- form a map (not pathalais output) name the net netname
#	-c cost		- set cost to gateway, or network is no gateway
#	-g gateway	- set the gateway for hosts to be gateway
#	-d		- only print lines that has domain hostnames
#	-		- read hosts table from stdin
#	filename	- read hosts table from filename
#	<no arg>	- read hosts from /etc/hosts
#
# The mkhostpath(8) command reads a hosts table from 'filename' or
# standard input if '-' is used, and constructs routes to that network.
# The hosts table is assumed to be in the format of the /etc/hosts
# database file.  That is, the first field (internet address) and any,
# domain based name (field containing a '.') are ignored.  The hosts
# 'localhost' and 'loghost' are also ignored.  Comment lines, beginning
# with a '#', and blank lines are also ignored.  If '-d' is specified
# and address does NOT contain an alias that is a domain based name,
# then that line is ignored.  (useful to ignore test lines)
#
# By default, mkhostpath(8) builds route table to the network in the format
# of the output of pathalias(8) with the '-i' option.  The '-n' network flag
# overrides this default.
#
# If a gateway is specified with the '-g' option, but the '-n' network
# option is not used, then all routes to the network (except for the route
# to the gateway) are prepended with the route "gateway!".  A route to from
# the localhost to the gateway is explicitly formed.
#
# If neither the '-g' gateway nor the '-n' network options are given,
# then direct routes from the localhost to each host are constructed.
#
# The mkhostpath command will build a pathalias map to the network if the
# name of the network is given via the '-n' option.  The construction of
# the map depends on if the '-g' gateway option is given.
#
# When the '-g' gateway and the '-n' network options are both used, then a
# route from the localhost to the gateway is established, and the gateway is
# inserted into the network list.  The localhost is not added to
# the network list, even if it appears as a sitename in the hosts table.
# The cost of the link between the localhost and the gateway is 'LOCAL',
# unless overridden by the '-c' cost option.  The cost of routes inside
# the network is fixed at 'LOCAL' and is not changed by the '-c' cost option.
#
# If no gateway is specified with the '-n' network option, then it is
# assumed that the localhost is in the network and thus the localhost
# is inserted into the network list.  The cost of routes inside the network
# is assumed to be 'LOCAL', unless changed by the '-c' cost option.
#
# The value of the '-c' option may be any valid pathalias(8) cost expression.
# The '-c' flag is ignored if the '-n' flag is not given.
