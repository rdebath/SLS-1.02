       _F_i_l_e  tests  each  argument  in an attempt to classify it.
       There are three sets of tests, performed  in  this  order:
       filesystem  tests, magic number tests, and language tests.
       The _f_i_r_s_t test that succeeds causes the file  type  to  be
       printed.

       The  type  printed  will  usually contain one of the words
       tteexxtt (the file contains only ASCII characters and is prob-
       ably  safe  to read on an ASCII terminal), eexxeeccuuttaabbllee (the
       file contains the result of compiling a program in a  form
       understandable  to  some  UNIX kernel or another), or ddaattaa
       meaning anything else (data is usually  `binary'  or  non-
       printable).   Exceptions are well-known file formats (core
       files, tar archives) that  are  known  to  contain  binary
       data.   When  modifying the file _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_g_i_c or the program
       itself, pprreesseerrvvee tthheessee kkeeyywwoorrddss ..  People depend on  know-
       ing  that  all  the readable files in a directory have the
       word ``text'' printed.  Don't do as  one  computer  vendor
       did  - change ``shell commands text'' to ``shell script''.

       The filesystem tests are based  on  examining  the  return
       from a _s_t_a_t _(_2_) system call.  The program checks to see if
       the file is empty, or if it's some sort of  special  file.
       Any  known  file  types  appropriate to the system you are
       running on (sockets and symbolic links  on  4.2BSD,  named
       pipes  (FIFOs)  on  System  V)  are  intuited  if they are
       defined in the system header file _s_y_s_/_s_t_a_t_._h _.

       The magic number tests are used to check  for  files  with
       data  in  particular fixed formats.  The canonical example
       of this is a binary executable  (compiled  program)  _a_._o_u_t
       file,  whose  format  is  defined  in _a_._o_u_t_._h and possibly
       _e_x_e_c_._h in the standard  include  directory.   These  files
       have  a  `magic  number' stored in a particular place near
       the beginning of the file that tells  the  UNIX  operating
       system  that the file is a binary executable, and which of
       several types thereof.  The concept of `magic number'  has
       been  applied  by  extension to data files.  Any file with
       some invariant identifier at a small fixed offset into the
       file  can  usually be described in this way.  The informa-
       tion in these files is read from the magic file _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_g_i_c
       _.

       If  an argument appears to be an ASCII file, _f_i_l_e attempts
       to guess its language.  The language tests look  for  par-
       ticular  strings  (cf _n_a_m_e_s_._h) that can appear anywhere in
       the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the  keyword

FILE(1)                                                   FILE(1)


       _._b_r  indicates  that the file is most likely a troff input
       file, just as the keyword _s_t_r_u_c_t indicates  a  C  program.
       These  tests  are  less  reliable  than  the  previous two
       groups, so they are performed  last.   The  language  test
       routines  also  test  for  some  miscellany  (such  as _t_a_r
       archives) and determine whether an unknown file should  be
       labelled as `ascii text' or `data'.

       Use --mm _f_i_l_e to specify an alternate file of magic numbers.

       The --cc option causes a checking  printout  of  the  parsed
       form  of the magic file.  This is usually used in conjunc-
       tion with --mm to debug a new magic file  before  installing
       it.

       The  --ff  _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e  option  specifies that the names of the
       files to be examined are to be read (one  per  line)  from
       _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e  before the argument list.  Either _n_a_m_e_f_i_l_e or at
       least one filename argument must be present; to  test  the
       standard input, use ``-'' as a filename argument.

       This  program is believed to exceed the System V Interface
       Definition of FILE(CMD), as near as one can determine from
       the  vague  language  contained therein.  Its behaviour is
       mostly compatible with the System V program  of  the  same
       name.   This version knows more magic, however, so it will
       produce different (albeit more accurate)  output  in  many
       cases.

       The  one  significant  difference between this version and
       System V is that this version treats any white space as  a
       delimiter,  so  that  spaces  in  pattern  strings must be
       escaped.  For example,
       >10  string    language impress    (imPRESS data)
       in an existing magic file would have to be changed to
       >10  string    language\ impress   (imPRESS data)

       The Sun Microsystems implementation of System  V  compati-
       bility  includes  a  file(1)  command that has some exten-
       tions.  My version differs from Sun's only in minor  ways.
       The  significant one is the `&' operator, which Sun's pro-
       gram expects as, for example,
       >16  long&0x7fffffff     >0        not stripped
       would be entered in my version as
       >16  long &0x7fffffff    not stripped
       which is a little less general; it simply tests  (location

       The magic file entries have been  collected  from  various
       sources,   mainly   USENET,  and  contributed  by  various
       authors.  Ian Darwin (address below)  will  collect  addi-
       tional  or  corrected magic file entries.  A consolidation
       of magic file entries will be distributed periodically.

       The order of entries in the  magic  file  is  significant.
       Depending  on  what  system  you are using, the order that
       they are put together may be incorrect.  If your old  _f_i_l_e
       command  uses a magic file, keep the old magic file around
       for comparison purposes (rename it to _/_e_t_c_/_m_a_g_i_c_._o_r_i_g).

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       There has been a _f_i_l_e command in every UNIX since at least
       Research  Version  6  (man page dated January, 1975).  The
       System V version introduced one significant major  change:
       the  external list of magic number types.  This slowed the
       program down slightly but made it a lot more flexible.

       This program, based on the System V version,  was  written
       by  Ian  Darwin  without  looking at anybody else's source
       code.

       John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it  bet-
       ter  than  the first version.  Geoff Collyer found several
       inadequacies and provided some magic  file  entries.   The
       program has undergone continued evolution since.

BBUUGGSS
       There must be a way to automate the  construction  of  the
       Magic file from all the glop in magdir. What is it?

       _F_i_l_e  uses  several algorithms that favor speed over accu-
       racy, thus it can be misled about the  contents  of  ASCII
       files.

       The  support  for  ASCII  files (primarily for programming
       languages) is simplistic, inefficient and requires  recom-
       pilation to update.

       Should  there  be an ``else'' clause to follow a series of
       continuation lines?

       Is it worthwhile to implement recursive  file  inspection,
       so  that compressed files, uuencoded, etc., can say ``com-
       pressed  ascii  text''  or  ``compressed  executable''  or
       ``compressed tar archive" or whatever?

       The magic file and keywords should have regular expression
       support.

       It might be advisable to allow upper-case letters in  key-
       words  for e.g., troff commands vs man page macros.  Regu-
       lar expression support would make this easy.

       The program doesn't grok FORTRAN.  It should  be  able  to
       figure  FORTRAN  by  seeing  some  keywords  which  appear
       indented at the start of line.  Regular expression support

       would make this easy.

       The  list  of keywords in _a_s_c_m_a_g_i_c probably belongs in the
       Magic file.  This could be done by using some keyword like
       `*' for the offset value.

       The  program  should  malloc  the  magic  file structures,
       rather than using a fixed-size array as at present.

       The magic file should be compiled into binary  (or  better
       yet,  fixed-length  ASCII  strings for use in heterogenous
       network environments) for faster startup.  Then  the  pro-
       gram  would  run  as  fast as the Version 7 program of the
       same name, with the flexibility of the System  V  version.
       But  then  there would have to be yet another magic number
       for the _m_a_g_i_c_._o_u_t file.

       Another optimisation would be to sort the  magic  file  so
       that  we  can  just  run  down all the tests for the first
       byte, first word, first long, etc, once  we  have  fetched
       it.   Complain  about conflicts in the magic file entries.
       Make a rule that the magic entries sort based on file off-
       set rather than position within the magic file?

       The  program  should  provide a way to give an estimate of
       ``how good'' a guess is.  We end up removing guesses (e.g.
       ``From  ''  as first 5 chars of file) because they are not
       as good as  other  guesses  (e.g.  ``Newsgroups:''  versus
       "Return-Path:").   Still,  if the others don't pan out, it
       should be possible to use the first guess.

       Perhaps the program should  automatically  try  all  tests
       with byte-swapping done, to avoid having to figure out the
       byte-swapped values when constructing the magic file.   Of
       course this will run more slowly, so it should probably be
       an option (-a?).

       This manual page, and particularly this  section,  is  too
       long.
