NAME
     rcsfile - format of RCS file

DESCRIPTION
     An RCS file's contents are described by the  grammar  below.
     The  text  is  free  format: space, backspace, tab, newline,
     vertical tab, form feed, and carriage return  (collectively,
     _w_h_i_t_e   _s_p_a_c_e)  have  no  significance  except  in  strings.
     Strings are enclosed by @.  If a string  contains  a  @,  it
     must  be  doubled;  otherwise, strings may contain arbitrary
     binary data.

     The meta syntax uses the following  conventions:  `|'  (bar)
     separates   alternatives;   `{'  and  `}'  enclose  optional
     phrases; `{' and `}*' enclose phrases that may  be  repeated
     zero  or  more times; `{' and '}+' enclose phrases that must
     appear at least once and may be repeated;  Terminal  symbols
     are in boldface; nonterminal symbols are in _i_t_a_l_i_c_s.

     _r_c_s_t_e_x_t    ::=  _a_d_m_i_n {_d_e_l_t_a}* _d_e_s_c {_d_e_l_t_a_t_e_x_t}*

     _a_d_m_i_n      ::=  head       {_n_u_m};

                     symbols    {_i_d : _n_u_m}*;
                     locks      {_i_d : _n_u_m}*;  {strict  ;}

                     branches   {_n_u_m}*;
                     next       {_n_u_m};

     _l_e_t_t_e_r     ::=  any letter

     _i_d_c_h_a_r     ::=  any visible graphic character except _s_p_e_c_i_a_l

     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l    ::=  $ | , | . | : | ; | @

     _s_t_r_i_n_g     ::=  @{any character, with @ doubled}*@

     _n_e_w_p_h_r_a_s_e  ::=  _i_d _w_o_r_d* ;

     _w_o_r_d       ::=  _i_d | _n_u_m | _s_t_r_i_n_g | :

     Identifiers are case sensitive.  Keywords are in lower  case
     only.  The sets of keywords and identifiers may overlap.  In
     most environments RCS uses the ISO 8859/1 encoding:  letters
     are  octal codes 101-132, 141-172, 300-326, 330-366 and 370-
     377,  visible  graphic  characters  are  codes  041-176  and
     240-377,  and  white  space characters are codes 010-015 and
     040.

     The _n_e_w_p_h_r_a_s_e productions in the grammar  are  reserved  for
     future  extensions to the format of RCS files.  No _n_e_w_p_h_r_a_s_e
     will begin with any keyword already in use.

     The _d_e_l_t_a nodes form a tree.  All nodes whose  numbers  con-
     sist of a single pair (e.g., 2.3, 2.1, 1.3, etc.) are on the
     trunk, and are linked through the next  field  in  order  of
     decreasing numbers.  The head field in the _a_d_m_i_n node points
     to the head of that sequence  (i.e.,  contains  the  highest
     pair).   The  branch  node  in  the admin node indicates the
     default branch (or revision) for most  RCS  operations.   If
     empty,  the  default  branch  is  the  highest branch on the
     trunk.

     All _d_e_l_t_a nodes whose  numbers  consist  of  2_n  fields  (_n)
     (e.g.,  3.1.1.1,  2.1.2.2, etc.) are linked as follows.  All
     nodes whose first  2_n-1  number  fields  are  identical  are
     linked  through  the  next  field  in  order  of  increasing
     numbers.  For each  such  sequence,  the  _d_e_l_t_a  node  whose
     number  is  identical to the first 2_n-2 number fields of the
     deltas on that sequence  is  called  the  branchpoint.   The
     branches  field  of a node contains a list of the numbers of
     the first nodes of all sequences for which  it  is  a  bran-
     chpoint.  This list is ordered in increasing numbers.
