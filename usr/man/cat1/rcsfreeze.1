NAME
     rcsfreeze - freeze a configuration  of  sources  checked  in
     under RCS

SYNOPSIS
     rcsfreeze [_n_a_m_e]

DESCRIPTION
     rcsfreeze assigns a symbolic revision number to a set of RCS
     files that form a valid configuration.

     The idea is to run rcsfreeze each  time  a  new  version  is
     checked  in.  A unique symbolic name (C__n_u_m_b_e_r, where _n_u_m_b_e_r
     is increased each time rcsfreeze is run) is then assigned to
     the most recent revision of each RCS file of the main trunk.

     An optional _n_a_m_e argument to rcsfreeze gives a symbolic name
     to  the  configuration.  The unique identifier is still gen-
     erated and is listed in the log file but it will not  appear
     as  part  of  the  symbolic  revision name in the actual RCS
     files.

     A log message is requested from the user for  future  refer-
     ence.

     The shell script works only on all RCS files  at  one  time.
     All   changed   files  must  be  checked  in  already.   Run
     _r_c_s_c_l_e_a_n(1) first and see whether any sources remain in  the
     current directory.

FILES
     RCS/.rcsfreeze.ver
          version number

     RCS/.rcsfreeze.log
          log messages, most recent first

BUGS
     rcsfreeze does not check whether any sources are checked out
     and modified.

     Although both source file  names  and  RCS  file  names  are
     accepted, they are not paired as usual with RCS commands.

     Error checking is rudimentary.

     rcsfreeze is just an  optional  example  shell  script,  and
     should  not be taken too seriously.  See CVS for a more com-
     plete solution.
