NAME
     rcsclean - clean up working files

SYNOPSIS
     rcsclean [_r_c_s_d_i_f_f _o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [_f_i_l_e ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     rcsclean removes working files that  were  checked  out  and
     never  modified.  For each file given, rcsclean compares the
     working file and a revision in the corresponding  RCS  file.
     If it finds no difference, it removes the working file, and,
     if the revision was locked, unlocks the revision.

     If no _f_i_l_e is given, all working files in the current direc-
     tory  are  cleaned.   Any  other options are passed along to
     rcsdiff for the comparison.

     rcsclean is useful for clean targets in Makefiles.  See also
     rcsdiff(1),  which  prints  out  the differences, and ci(1),
     which normally asks whether to check in a file if it was not
     changed.

EXAMPLES
          rcsclean  *.c  *.h

     removes all working files ending in .c or .h that  were  not
     changed since their checkout.
          rcsclean

     removes all working files in the current directory that were
     not changed since their checkout.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The exit status is 0 if there were  no  differences  in  any
     file  under  RCS control, 1 if there were differences, and 2
     if there were errors.

     Any diagnostics generated by rcsdiff  when  comparing  files
     are discarded.

     If the latest revision is already unlocked, and you  have  a
     lock  on  an  earlier  revision,  the  earlier  revision  is
     unlocked.

     rcsclean is just  an  optional  example  shell  script,  and
     should not be taken too seriously.
