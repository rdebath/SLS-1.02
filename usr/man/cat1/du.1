       This manual page documents the GNU version of dduu.  dduu dis-
       plays  the  amount of disk space used by each argument and
       for each subdirectory of directory arguments.   The  space
       is  measured  in 1K blocks by default, unless the environ-
       ment  variable  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  set,  in  which  case
       512-byte blocks are used.

       _-_a_, _-_-_a_l_l
              Display counts for all files, not just directories.

       _-_b_, _-_-_b_y_t_e_s
              Print sizes in bytes.

       _-_c_, _-_-_t_o_t_a_l
              Write a grand total of all of the  arguments  after
              all  arguments  have  been  processed.  This can be
              used to find out the disk  usage  of  a  directory,
              with some files excluded.

       _-_k_, _-_-_k_i_l_o_b_y_t_e_s
              Print sizes in kilobytes.  This overrides the envi-
              ronment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT.

       _-_l_, _-_-_c_o_u_n_t_-_l_i_n_k_s
              Count the size of all  files,  even  if  they  have
              appeared already in another hard link.

       _-_s_, _-_-_s_u_m_m_a_r_i_z_e
              Display only a total for each argument.

       _-_x_, _-_-_o_n_e_-_f_i_l_e_-_s_y_s_t_e_m
              Skip  directories that are on different filesystems
              from the one that the argument being  processed  is
              on.

       _-_D_, _-_-_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_-_a_r_g_s
              Dereference  symbolic  links  that are command line
              arguments.  Does not affect other  symbolic  links.
              This  is  helpful for finding out the disk usage of
              directories like /usr/tmp where they  are  symbolic
              links.

       _-_L_, _-_-_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Dereference  symbolic  links  (show  the disk space
              used by the file or directory that the link  points
              to instead of the space used by the link).

       _-_S_, _-_-_s_e_p_a_r_a_t_e_-_d_i_r_s
              Count  the  size  of each directory separately, not
              including the sizes of subdirectories.

       On BSD systems, dduu reports sizes that are half the correct
       values  for files that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems.
       On HP-UX systems, it reports sizes that are twice the cor-
       rect  values  for files that are NFS-mounted from BSD sys-
       tems.  This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also affects the
       HP-UX dduu program.

       The  long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well
       as `--', for compatibility with previous releases.   Even-
       tually  support  for  `+'  will  be removed, because it is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
