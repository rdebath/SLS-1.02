NAME
     ar-create, modify, and extract from archives.


SYNOPSIS
     ar [-]_p_m_o_d [_m_e_m_b_e_r_n_a_m_e] _a_r_c_h_i_v_e _f_i_l_e_s...


DESCRIPTION
     The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and extracts from  ar-
     chives.  An _a_r_c_h_i_v_e is a single file holding a collection of
     other files in a structure that makes  it  possible  to  re-
     trieve  the original individual files (called _m_e_m_b_e_r_s of the
     archive).

     The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp,
     owner,  and  group  are preserved in the archive, and may be
     reconstituted on extraction.

     GNU ar can maintain archives whose members have names of any
     length;  however,  depending on how ar is configured on your
     system, a limit on member-name length may  be  imposed  (for
     compatibility  with  archive  formats  maintained with other
     tools).  If it exists, the  limit  is  often  15  characters
     (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters (typ-
     ical of formats related to coff).

     ar is considered a binary utility because archives  of  this
     sort are most often used as _l_i_b_r_a_r_i_e_s holding commonly need-
     ed subroutines.

     ar will create an index to the symbols defined  in  relocat-
     able  object  modules  in  the  archive when you specify the
     modifier `s'.  Once created, this index is  updated  in  the
     archive whenever ar makes a change to its contents (save for
     the `q' update operation).  An archive with  such  an  index
     speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in the
     library to call each other without regard to their placement
     in the archive.

     You may use `nm -s' or `nm +print-armap' to list this  index
     table.   If  an  archive lacks the table, another form of ar
     called ranlib can be used to add just the table.

     ar insists  on  at  least  two  arguments  to  execute:  one
     keyletter  specifying  the _o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n (optionally accompanied
     by other keyletters specifying _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s), and  the  archive
     name to act on.

     Most operations can also  accept  further  _f_i_l_e_s  arguments,
     specifying particular files to operate on.

OPTIONS
     GNU ar allows you to mix the operation code _p  and  modifier
     flags  _m_o_d in any order, within the first command-line argu-
     ment.

     If you wish, you may begin the first  command-line  argument
     with a dash.

     The _p keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it  may
     be  any  of  the following, but you must specify only one of
     them:


     d    _D_e_l_e_t_e modules from the archive.  Specify the names  of
          modules  to  be  deleted  as  _f_i_l_e_s; the archive is un-
          touched if you specify no files to delete.

          If you specify the `v'  modifier,  ar  will  list  each
          module as it is deleted.


     m    Use this operation to _m_o_v_e members in an archive.

          The ordering of  members  in  an  archive  can  make  a
          difference  in  how  programs  are linked using the li-
          brary, if a symbol is defined in more than one member.

          If no modifiers are used with m, any members  you  name
          in  the _f_i_l_e_s arguments are moved to the _e_n_d of the ar-
          chive; you can use the `a', `b', or  `i'  modifiers  to
          move them to a specified place instead.


     p    _P_r_i_n_t the specified members  of  the  archive,  to  the
          standard  output  file.   If the `v' modifier is speci-
          fied, show the member name before copying its  contents
          to standard output.

          If you specify no _f_i_l_e_s, all the files in  the  archive
          are printed.


     q    _Q_u_i_c_k _a_p_p_e_n_d; add _f_i_l_e_s to the end of _a_r_c_h_i_v_e,  without
          checking for replacement.

          The modifiers `a', `b', and  `i'  do  _n_o_t  affect  this
          operation;  new members are always placed at the end of
          the archive.

          The modifier `v' makes ar list each file as it  is  ap-
          pended.

          Since  the  point  of  this  operation  is  speed,  the
          archive's symbol table index is not updated, even if it
          already existed; you can use `ar s' or ranlib explicit-
          ly to update the symbol table index.


     r    Insert _f_i_l_e_s  into  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e  (with  _r_e_p_l_a_c_e_m_e_n_t).  This
          operation  differs  from `q' in that any previously ex-
          isting members are deleted if their names  match  those
          being added.

          If one of the files named in _f_i_l_e_s  doesn't  exist,  ar
          displays  an  error message, and leaves undisturbed any
          existing members of the archive matching that name.

          By default, new members are added at  the  end  of  the
          file; but you may use one of the modifiers `a', `b', or
          `i' to request  placement  relative  to  some  existing
          member.

          The modifier `v' used with  this  operation  elicits  a
          line  of  output for each file inserted, along with one
          of the letters `a' or `r' to indicate whether the  file
          was appended (no old member deleted) or replaced.


     t    Display a _t_a_b_l_e listing the  contents  of  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e,  or
          those  of the files listed in _f_i_l_e_s that are present in
          the archive.  Normally only the member name  is  shown;
          if you also want to see the modes (permissions), times-
          tamp, owner, group, and size, you can request  that  by
          also specifying the `v' modifier.

          If you do not specify any _f_i_l_e_s, all files in  the  ar-
          chive are listed.

          If there is more than one file with the same name (say,
          `fie')  in  an archive (say `b.a'), `ar t b.a fie' will
          list only the first instance; to see them all, you must
          ask for a complete listing-in our example, `ar t b.a'.


     x    _E_x_t_r_a_c_t members (named _f_i_l_e_s) from  the  archive.   You
          can  use  the  `v' modifier with this operation, to re-
          quest that ar list each name as it extracts it.

          If you do not specify any _f_i_l_e_s, all files in  the  ar-
          chive are extracted.


     A number of modifiers (_m_o_d) may  immediately  follow  the  _p
     keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior:

ar(1)                 GNU Development Tools                 ar(1)



     a    Add new files _a_f_t_e_r an existing member of the  archive.
          If  you use the modifier a, the name of an existing ar-
          chive member must be present as  the  _m_e_m_b_e_r_n_a_m_e  argu-
          ment, before the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e specification.


     b    Add new files _b_e_f_o_r_e an existing member of the archive.
          If  you use the modifier b, the name of an existing ar-
          chive member must be present as  the  _m_e_m_b_e_r_n_a_m_e  argu-
          ment, before the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e specification.  (same as `i').


     c    _C_r_e_a_t_e the archive.  The specified  _a_r_c_h_i_v_e  is  always
          created if it didn't exist, when you request an update.
          But a warning is issued unless you specify  in  advance
          that you expect to create it, by using this modifier.


     i    Insert new files _b_e_f_o_r_e an existing member of  the  ar-
          chive.   If  you use the modifier i, the name of an ex-
          isting archive member must be present as the _m_e_m_b_e_r_n_a_m_e
          argument,  before  the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e specification.  (same as
          `b').


     l    This modifier is accepted but not used.


     o    Preserve the _o_r_i_g_i_n_a_l dates of members when  extracting
          them.   If  you do not specify this modifier, files ex-
          tracted from the archive will be stamped with the  time
          of extraction.


     s    Write an object-file index into the archive, or  update
          an existing one, even if no other change is made to the
          archive.  You may use this modifier  flag  either  with
          any  operation, or alone.  Running `ar s' on an archive
          is equivalent to running `ranlib' on it.


     u    Normally, ar r... inserts all files listed into the ar-
          chive.   If  you would like to insert _o_n_l_y those of the
          files you list that are newer than existing members  of
          the same names, use this modifier.  The `u' modifier is
          allowed only for the operation `r' (replace).  In  par-
          ticular,  the  combination  `qu'  is not allowed, since
          checking the timestamps would lose any speed  advantage
          from the operation `q'.


     v    This modifier requests the _v_e_r_b_o_s_e version of an opera-

          tion.
           Many operations display additional  information,  such
          as  filenames  processed,  when the modifier `v' is ap-
          pended.
