NAME
     rlog - print log messages and other  information  about  RCS
     files

SYNOPSIS
     rlog [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _f_i_l_e ...

DESCRIPTION
     rlog prints information about RCS files.  File names  ending
     in ,v denote RCS files; all others denote working files.  If
     a working file is given, rlog tries to find the  correspond-
     ing  RCS  file  first in an RCS subdirectory and then in the
     working file's directory, as explained in co(1).

     rlog prints the following information for each RCS file: RCS
     file  name, working file name, head (i.e., the number of the
     latest revision on the trunk), default branch, access  list,
     locks,  symbolic  names,  suffix, total number of revisions,
     number of revisions selected for printing,  and  descriptive
     text.   This  is  followed by entries for the selected revi-
     sions in reverse chronological order for each  branch.   For
     each   revision,   rlog   prints  revision  number,  author,
     date/time,  state,  number  of  lines  added/deleted   (with
     respect  to  the  previous revision), locker of the revision
     (if any), and log message.  All times are displayed in  GMT.
     Without  options,  rlog  prints  complete  information.  The
     options below restrict this output.

     -L  Ignore RCS files that have no locks set.  This  is  con-
         venient in combination with -h, -l, and -R.

     -R  Print only the name of the RCS file.  This is convenient
         for  translating  a  working  file name into an RCS file
         name.

     -h  Print only the RCS file name, working file  name,  head,
         default  branch, access list, locks, symbolic names, and
         suffix.

     -t  Print the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.

     -b  Print information about the  revisions  on  the  default
         branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.

     -d_d_a_t_e_s
         Print  information  about  revisions  with   a   checkin
         date/time in the ranges given by the semicolon-separated
         list of _d_a_t_e_s.  A range  of  the  form  _d_1<_d_2  or  _d_2>_d_1
         selects the revisions that were deposited between _d_1 and
         _d_2 inclusive.  A range of the form <_d or _d> selects  all
         revisions dated _d or earlier.  A range of the form _d< or
         >_d selects all revisions dated _d or later.  A  range  of

         the  form  _d selects the single, latest revision dated _d
         or earlier.  The date/time strings _d, _d_1, and _d_2 are  in
         the free format explained in co(1).  Quoting is normally
         necessary, especially  for  <  and  >.   Note  that  the
         separator is a semicolon.

     -l[_l_o_c_k_e_r_s]
         Print information about locked revisions only.  In addi-
         tion, if the comma-separated list _l_o_c_k_e_r_s of login names
         is given, ignore all locks other than those held by  the
         _l_o_c_k_e_r_s.   For  example, rlog -L -R -lwft RCS/*,v prints
         the name of RCS files locked by the user wft.

     -r_r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s
         prints information about revisions given in  the  comma-
         separated  list  _r_e_v_i_s_i_o_n_s  of  revisions and ranges.  A
         range _r_e_v_1-_r_e_v_2 means revisions _r_e_v_1 to _r_e_v_2 on the same
         branch,  -_r_e_v  means revisions from the beginning of the
         branch up to and including _r_e_v, and _r_e_v- means revisions
         starting  with  _r_e_v  to the end of the branch containing
         _r_e_v.  An argument that is a branch means  all  revisions
         on that branch.  A range of branches means all revisions
         on the branches in that range.

     -s_s_t_a_t_e_s
         prints information about revisions  whose  state  attri-
         butes  match  one  of  the  states  given  in the comma-
         separated list _s_t_a_t_e_s.

     -w[_l_o_g_i_n_s]
         prints information about revisions checked in  by  users
         with  login  names appearing in the comma-separated list
         _l_o_g_i_n_s.  If _l_o_g_i_n_s  is  omitted,  the  user's  login  is
         assumed.

     -V_n Emulate RCS version _n when generating logs.   See  co(1)
         for more.

     rlog prints the intersection of the revisions selected  with
     the  options  -d, -l, -s, and -w, intersected with the union
     of the revisions selected by -b and -r.

EXAMPLES
         rlog  -L  -R  RCS/*,v
         rlog  -L  -h  RCS/*,v
         rlog  -L  -l  RCS/*,v
         rlog  RCS/*,v

     The first command prints the names of all RCS files  in  the
     subdirectory RCS that have locks.  The second command prints
     the headers of those files, and the third prints the headers
     plus  the  log  messages  of the locked revisions.  The last
